	This article would have been more relevant had I actually found the time to write it <em>before</em> The IPA Connoisseur&rsquo;s Week 13 game, but whatever. <em>Que sera, sera.</em><br/>
	<br/>
	IPA is quite the intriguing case study this season. They are, if you will, the Texas Tech Red Raiders of the JADDL. Started red hot, finished like a dumpster fire.<br/>
	<br/>
	Flash back to Week 6. Entering interdivision play, The Connoisseur was 5-0, having run roughshod over its West comrades in the season&rsquo;s first leg. IPA outscored its opponents 501.6 to 406.2 over that stretch.<br/>
	<br/>
	The run at perfection was halted in IPA&rsquo;s first interdivision game against the then 1-4 Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks, but The Connoisseur bounced back impressively, winning its final two interdivision games against two very competent Eastern teams, The Bad News Bensons and Team Odouls.<br/>
	<br/>
	So there IPA was, 7-1, atop the West, ready to dominate divisional foes for a second time en route to a sure Jared&rsquo;s Goblet and first-round bye in the playoffs.<br/>
	<div class="news-quote">It&rsquo;s just &hellip; I mean, I don&rsquo;t even &hellip;<div class="author">Lannie</div></div>
	<br/>
	Then they lost to the hapless Red Hornets.<br/>
	<br/>
	And then In Pursuit of Perfection.<br/>
	<br/>
	Followed by the Tulsa Angry Monkeys.<br/>
	<br/>
	And Team Hauloll.<br/>
	<br/>
	Uh oh. Suddenly, not only was Jared&rsquo;s Goblet out of reach, but The Connoisseur were in danger of missing the playoffs completely. At 7-5, should they lose to the One Pump Chumps, and should IPP beat Hauloll while the Monkeys beat the Hornets, the final playoff spot in the West would come down to total points.<br/>
	<br/>
	Lannie was at a loss for words to describe his team&rsquo;s collapse. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just &hellip; I mean, I don&rsquo;t even &hellip;&rdquo;<br/>
	<br/>
	A date with the Chumps couldn&rsquo;t come at a better time, but let&rsquo;s not forget IPA has losses already to a 1-4 Shanks squad, as well as a 1-7 Hornets team. So a 2-10 Chumps outfit cannot be overlooked at this critical juncture.<br/>
	<br/>
	The odds are in IPA&rsquo;s favor, however. As you can expect, no 7-1 team has ever gone on to miss the playoffs.<br/>
	<br/>
	Lannie hopes his franchise isn&rsquo;t the first.
