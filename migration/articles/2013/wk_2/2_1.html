	A year ago, the Red Hornets lost seven straight games to open the season before finally winning one in Week 8. And let&rsquo;s be honest: they only won in Week 8 because they got to play the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks.<br/>
	<br/>
	Well, 2013 is a new year, and the Hornets&mdash;like the &rsquo;Shanks the week before&mdash;announced loudly that they plan on things going differently this time around, in the form of a 151.8&ndash;94.4 thrashing of the One Pump Chumps (0-2).<br/>
	<div class="news-quote">We&rsquo;re very tuned in to the ticking of the clock and flipping of the calendar here in the Mountain Time Zone.<div class="author">Dan</div></div>
	<br/>
	This burst from the Hornets nearly matched the total they put up last season in weeks 5 and 6 <em>combined</em> (152.1). The year before that, the Hornets scored less than 152 combined points over a two-week stretch on <em>four separate occasions.</em> Needless to say, this franchise has nowhere to go but up from its recent history.<br/>
	<br/>
	&ldquo;2011 was 2011, last year was last year, and this year is this year,&rdquo; said Dan following the game. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re very tuned in to the ticking of the clock and flipping of the calendar here in the Mountain Time Zone, and that awareness of past events being just that&mdash;past events that don&rsquo;t dictate the future&mdash;is what I try to instill in my players each and every week.&rdquo;<br/>
	<br/>
	&hellip;You didn&rsquo;t really think we were going to have a Red Hornets article without a <em>Mountain Time</em> mention, did you? Sorry, Dan.<br/>
	<br/>
	Since we&rsquo;re on that subject, it&rsquo;s worth noting that since the league-issued warning after the first week of 2011, the Hornets&rsquo; front office has successfully avoided activating any players who had been ruled out for a given week&rsquo;s games. Well done, Dan. (That just goes to show you all the power the JADDL league office wields.)<br/>
	<br/>
	Now, back to this stellar performance by the &rsquo;Nets in Week 2.<br/>
	<br/>
	Marshawn &ldquo;Skittles&rdquo; Lynch topped the charts with 31.5 points, but the game was well in hand before his Monday Night Football frenzy. All non-kickers for the Hornets got into double figures, with notably impressive outings from Julio Jones (26.2) and Jordy Nelson (18.6), as well as a surprising 16 points from the Patriots D/ST.<br/>
	<br/>
	What brought on this encouraging onslaught from a squad that went 2-11 a year ago? &ldquo;I had to bring in Bobby Knight for a pregame speech to light a fire under their asses,&rdquo; Dan admitted.<br/>
	<br/>
	In fact, the Hornets breached the one-fifty plateau despite getting an uninspired 11.2 points from QB Tom Brady. And, despite the easy victory for his team, <a href="assets/images/tompissed_original.gif" data-lightbox="brady-pissed" title="Even guys who sleep with Gisele aren&rsquo;t happy <em>all</em> the time.">Brady was visibly agitated on the sidelines</a> during the game, reportedly yelling &ldquo;Come on, leave Miley alone!&rdquo; When asked about the incident afterward, Brady simply said, &ldquo;Bitches be crazy, you know that.&rdquo;<br/>
	<br/>
	Well, one thing we do know is that the Hornets (1-1) have outscored the rest of the West through two weeks, and that&rsquo;s a welcome change of pace for Hornets fans desperate to see its franchise get back its former glory.<br/>
	<br/>
	Depth may be a concern, however. The Hornets&rsquo; bench put up just 21.9 points total, and 12.6 of those came from its backup QB, Big Ben Whataburger. Can a team which has to start either Rashard Mendenhall or Montee Ball each week do serious damage over the long term? We&rsquo;ll have to wait for the answer.<br/>
	<br/>
	(The answer is no.)
