	Those of you who are fans of HBO&rsquo;s <em>Game of Thrones</em>&mdash;or George R. R. Martin&rsquo;s <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> series&mdash;will appreciate that headline more than others, but the point is a simple one.<br/>
	<br/>
	We will complete yet another year without an 0-13 team, thanks to the One Pump Chumps getting off the snide with an 81.8&ndash;66.4 victory over perennial East power, The Mighty Boom.<br/>
	<br/>
	Of <em>course</em> the last winless team in the league would end its losing streak against perhaps the league&rsquo;s greatest franchise. When you play in the JADDL, things like that just make sense. The Chumps are actually the second team to end lengthy losing streaks against Boom this year. The Shanks halted their streak at 12 in the first week of this season. OPC&rsquo;s streak was at seven.<br/>
	<br/>
	Jesse has taken a lot of heat for drafting Aaron Rodgers fourth overall in this year&rsquo;s draft. That&rsquo;s a reach if there ever was one. But if Rodgers could have, say, repeated his 2011 campaign, the pick could have been defended reasonably.<br/>
	<br/>
	Alas, Rodgers is not having quite such a stellar season. He&rsquo;s averaging 22 points per game, compared to somewhere around the 30 he averaged in &rsquo;11. To justify his pick slot, Rodgers would have needed to significantly outpace his QB competition. Not only is he not doing that; he&rsquo;s not even the number one quarterback in the league&mdash;that would be Peyton Manning, pick #19. Rodgers is also behind Drew Brees (pick #15).<br/>
	<div class="news-quote">What better way to play the role of spoiler than handing an East contender a humiliating loss?<div class="author">Jesse</div></div>
	<br/>
	Furthermore, there are seven other QBs within five points of Rodgers&rsquo; average so far this season.<br/>
	<br/>
	So, we ask the age-old draft question: if not Rodgers, then who? Well, Jamaal Charles went one pick later to the Millennium Falcons. Yes, <em>that</em> Jamaal Charles &hellip; the top running back in the league, the NFL&rsquo;s front-runner for MVP.<br/>
	<br/>
	Let&rsquo;s say the Chumps took Charles&mdash;<em>that</em> Charles&mdash;instead of Rodgers at #4. Jesse still could have snagged Cam Newton or Matthew Stafford in a later round; two players averaging within three points of Rodgers. And Jesse would have Jamaal Charles and his 18 points per game instead of Maurice Jones-Drew (7.8 PPG) or BenJarvus Green-Ellis (6.5 PPG).<br/>
	<br/>
	&hellip; For fuck&rsquo;s sake, what are the Chumps, the All Hyphenated Last Names team?<br/>
	<br/>
	Anyway, such is life in the JADDL. You live, you regret, you learn, you move on. And none of that buyer&rsquo;s remorse was present this past weekend as the Chumps, at least for one game, got to shake off that sense of helplessness that goes with occupying the bottom of the standings, and play with a sense of pride and belonging.<br/>
	<br/>
	Fittingly, they were led by Rodgers with 24.5 points. Jones-Drew pitched in with just his third double-digit outing of the year.<br/>
	<br/>
	&ldquo;Look, it&rsquo;s no secret we&rsquo;re in spoiler mode at this time,&rdquo; said Jesse. &ldquo;But what better way to play the role of spoiler than handing an East contender a humiliating loss?&rdquo;<br/>
	<br/>
	Humiliating for Boom the loss may have been, but it did not come as a surprise to Boom&rsquo;s owner. &ldquo;When you practice like shit, you play like shit, and &lsquo;shit&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t even begin to describe how we practiced this week,&rdquo; Pete said following the game.<br/>
	<br/>
	For the Chumps, this win doesn&rsquo;t move the needle in the grand scheme of things in all likelihood. But it gives them something to build on. Something to move forward with. It gives them a suitable first chapter in the OPC Book of Rebuilding.<br/>
	<br/>
	They won the league in 2003, and again in 2011. They aren&rsquo;t going to win it in 2013, but they&rsquo;ll be back sooner rather than later.<br/>
	<br/>
	You can count on it.
