	At 8:49 AM CDT, October 30th, a trade was born. In exchange for Philip Rivers, the The Boom had decided to hand over the rights to Benjamin Tate.<br/>
	<br/>
	By 2:12 PM CDT, this trade was dead. For the first time in league history, JADDL owners banded together to prevent what they believed was an overwhelmingly one-sided trade. This has never happened before.<br/>
	<div class="news-quote">Another first for the JADDL in the books, and another example of the true power of the JADDL: its owners.</div>
	<br/>
	What started everything is the fact that The Boom has a problem. And that problem&rsquo;s name is Matty Ice.<br/>
	<br/>
	He&rsquo;s currently the 12th ranked quarterback in the league, but it&rsquo;s only going to get worse from here. Both of Ryan&rsquo;s top two wideouts, Julio Jones and Roddy White, are out. Jones ain&rsquo;t coming back, and White&rsquo;s still nursing an ankle injury with no real urgency to return to this awful Falcons (Hotlanta, not Millennium) team. Boom&rsquo;s quarterback problem is so big that he just lost to the One Pump Chumps. Yes, the (Once) Mighty Boom somehow got out-chumped by the Chumps.<br/>
	<br/>
	As it stands, Boom is now 5-3 in an increasingly competitive East Division, with three 4-4 teams competing with the Boom for (probably) only two playoff spots. In response to the Internet fury from Boom fan sites when Mr. Anderson unveiled Jake &ldquo;The Locker Room&rdquo; Locker as the probable starter for this weekend&rsquo;s matchup, management decided it was time to make a move. Little did he know at the time how easy it would be to land a top flight quarterback.<br/>
	<br/>
	How easy it <em>would</em> have been, that is, if the other owners of the league hadn&rsquo;t rallied together to prevent the Boom/IPA trade with their individual veto power.<br/>
	<br/>
	But veto it they did, and in resounding fashion. In less than half an hour after discussion had begun amongst owners about the trade, the league office received the necessary six votes required.<br/>
	<br/>
	Information is still coming in about how this all went down, but this is what we know so far &hellip;<br/>
	<br/>
	<strong>1:47 PM</strong><br/>
	<br/>
	The Bad News Bensons front office sends a communication to the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks expressing concern over the trade&rsquo;s fairness. This is when the Shanks front office first became aware of the trade. A brief conversation ensued, and the two franchises decided to organize a protest of the trade.<br/>
	<br/>
	Because this is the year 2013, that protest was of course delivered via Twitter.<br/>
	<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="" src="assets/images/articles/2013/boom-ipa-tweet-1.png" /><br/>
	<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="" src="assets/images/articles/2013/boom-ipa-tweet-2.png" /><br/>
	<br/>
	But Alex and Ryan had a problem. Because a veto requires six votes, they&rsquo;d need to acquire the support of at least one West owner, assuming the other three non-Boom owners could be counted on for their votes. That threatened to be a tall task, considering the trade in question moved a productive player <em>out</em> of the West.<br/>
	<br/>
	<strong>2:04 PM</strong><br/>
	<br/>
	The Shanks front office reaches out to In Pursuit of Perfection headquarters. The message read, &ldquo;If you have a conscience, you MUST veto that Boom/IPA trade. That thing is complete bullshit. If we don&rsquo;t set a good precedent now, the same thing could happen in reverse, benefiting one of your West foes.&rdquo;<br/>
	<br/>
	The initial response from IPP was unfavorable. &ldquo;I would have wanted more [if I were Lannie],&rdquo; Nolan wrote, &ldquo;but I do not think the trade is that one-sided.&rdquo;<br/>
	<br/>
	The Shanks front office persisted, citing Ben Tate&rsquo;s four broken ribs as a reason to doubt he&rsquo;d be any sort of insurance for Arian Foster whatsoever, and that Rivers is actually a more valuable handcuff to Cam Newton than Tate would be to Foster.<br/>
	<br/>
	IPP&rsquo;s office sent word that they were not aware of Tate&rsquo;s injury, and confessed that were the teams reversed in this trade, IPP would most certainly fight to veto such a lopsided influx of productivity to a West rival.<br/>
	<br/>
	<strong>2:10 PM</strong><br/>
	<br/>
	The IPP front office sends a final reply to Longshanks HQ: &ldquo;Convincing argument. Trade vetoed.&rdquo;<br/>
	<br/>
	IPP&rsquo;s vote was an addition to the known votes from the Bensons, Shanks, Falcons, and Team Odouls. That left the tally at five, right?<br/>
	<br/>
	Wrong.<br/>
	<br/>
	<strong>2:11 PM</strong><br/>
	<br/>
	An email is sent to the league from JADDL headquarters. Subject: &ldquo;A Trade in Your ESPN Fantasy Football League Has Been Vetoed.&rdquo;<br/>
	<br/>
	What happened? Where did that sixth vote come from? It had to be from a West owner, because the front office of The Lawrence Football Jesus did not cast its vote by the time the controversy had come to a close.<br/>
	<br/>
	And therein lies the true intrigue here: a West franchise cast a veto vote without any coaxing or imploring from the East contingent. That just serves as evidence that the trade was probably as one-sided as members of the East claimed.<br/>
	<br/>
	But the most damning evidence for the trade&rsquo;s unfairness was yet to come &hellip;<br/>
	<br/>
	<strong>4:12 PM</strong><br/>
	<br/>
	The IPA Connoisseur front office agrees to comment on the afternoon&rsquo;s events.<br/>
	<br/>
	&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think either Peter or I thought it was a terrible trade &hellip; until you look a little closer,&rdquo; Lannie said. &ldquo;I think the broken ribs were the biggest problem.&rdquo;<br/>
	<br/>
	Reporters asked Lannie if&mdash;with all things considered, including the Tate injury&mdash;he thought, in retrospect, the trade was lopsided.<br/>
	<br/>
	Lannie agreed that it was.<br/>
	<br/>
	No official statement has come forth from The Mighty Boom&rsquo;s front office to this point. A potentially ambiguous tweet did come out, however:<br/>
	<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="" src="assets/images/articles/2013/boom-ipa-tweet-6.png" /><br/>
	<br/>
	And there are reports that a not-so-ambiguous communication was sent from the Boom offices to Longshanks headquarters. It said, simply, &ldquo;Fuck you,&rdquo; according to those reports.<br/>
	<br/>
	Well, there you have it. Another first for the JADDL in the books, and another example of the true power of the JADDL: its owners.<br/>
