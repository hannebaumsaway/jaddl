	It&rsquo;s easy to simply line teams in the JADDL up by their point totals and say to yourself, <em>That&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s going to be.</em><br/>
	<br/>
	Easy, lazy, and usually wrong.<br/>
	<br/>
	Only once in league history has a team which topped its division in points in the regular season gone on to win the Jared Bowl later that year (the Chumps did it in 2011).<br/>
	<br/>
	So when we take a look at the West Division, the first thing we notice &hellip; well, okay, the <em>first</em> thing we notice is how shitty the division is as a whole.<br/>
	<br/>
	The second thing we notice is that The IPA Connoisseurs sit atop that shitty division in both record and points. Now, maybe IPA will go ahead and win the division, win a couple playoff games, and clear space in the lobby of their front office for the Court-Ordered Limousine.<br/>
	<div class="news-quote">I don&rsquo;t worry about who is on the other sideline. I just worry about whether they&rsquo;ll score under 80 so we can win.<div class="author">Nolan</div></div>
	<br/>
	But don&rsquo;t write that scenario in your diaries just yet, because it could just as easily play out that way for a team like In Pursuit of Perfection; a team which is flying under everyone&rsquo;s radar.<br/>
	<br/>
	Pursuit started the year 0-2, which is why they&rsquo;ve gone unnoticed and unappreciated to date. But since that 0-2 start, they&rsquo;ve rattled off four consecutive wins and are nipping at IPA&rsquo;s heels for point supremacy in the West.<br/>
	<br/>
	In addition, they have perhaps the easiest interdivisional schedule of any team. That started with Team Odouls, which IPP dispatched 87.1&ndash;72.3 behind strong performances from front man Drew Brees, DeSean Jackson &ndash; currently the league&rsquo;s top receiver &ndash; and Alfred Morris.<br/>
	<br/>
	When Peyton Manning showed up in his Clark Kent outfit, Odouls had nothing with which to counter Pursuit. Manning has been human three times this season, and that&rsquo;s equated directly to three losses for the Near-Beers. So, yeah, it&rsquo;s not hard to figure out what makes Adam&rsquo;s season tick.<br/>
	<br/>
	Back to IPP&rsquo;s schedule. Did you see who they have coming up next? The Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks, followed by The Lawrence Football Jesus. So that&rsquo;s a combined 4-8 record IPP gets to tangle with the next two weeks. Who did Nolan pay off to get that draw? Good god.<br/>
	<br/>
	&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t worry about who is on the other sideline,&rdquo; said Nolan. &ldquo;I just worry about whether they&rsquo;ll score under 80 so we can win.&rdquo;<br/>
	<br/>
	He&rsquo;s referencing the fact that in IPP&rsquo;s four straight victories, none of its opponents have managed to crack 80 points. Hell, only one of them cracked 75.<br/>
	<br/>
	There&rsquo;s also the fact that the Shanks and Jesus have been playing much better of late &ndash; particularly in Jesus&rsquo;s case. But still; if you&rsquo;re going to pick two teams from the East to spar with, you&rsquo;re picking those two every day of the week, and twice on Hump Day.<br/>
	<br/>
	In order for this surge to really make waves, Pursuit will have to temporarily figure out what to do without DeMarco Murray, who went down in this past week&rsquo;s game. Sports writers everywhere are permanently copying the phrase &ldquo;DeMarco Murray injured&rdquo; to their clipboards so they can paste it to their Twitter feeds annually.
