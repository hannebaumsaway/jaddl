	In the <a href="news/2013/wk_4/index.php?view=news&amp;yr=2013&amp;wk=preseason&amp;pg=1" target="_blank">2013 season preview</a>, this publication pointed out the fact that perhaps success should be expected from the Millennium Falcons franchise, considering the football pedigree of its owner and general manager. Ian played football at a much higher level than any of his JADDL peers, etc., etc. (go read the article if you need a refresher).<br/>

	<br/>
	Well, if fans are indeed expecting success at a high level from Ian and his Falcons, they certainly are rising to the occasion so far. This past weekend&rsquo;s 135.3&ndash;116.4 victory over arch-nemesis The Bad News Bensons kept the Falcons perfect and moved them to 4-0 on the season.<br/>
	<br/>
	This victory was notable for a couple reasons.<br/>
	<br/>
	The Falcons became the first team in JADDL history to start a season 4-0 the year after they won the whole fuckin&rsquo; thing. In fact, they&rsquo;re just the second team ever to have even a <em>winning record</em> after four weeks following a title year &ndash; the other was Team Hauloll in 2010 at 3-1.<br/>
	<br/>
	Not only that, but this was Millennium&rsquo;s eighth straight win overall, dating back to the final week of the 2012 regular season. The Falcons now have their sights set on breaking the record for consecutive wins (12) set by Team Odouls in 2007.<br/>
	<br/>
	The win also continued a personal crusade for Ian to completely reverse his fortunes against big brother[-in-law] Alex. If you&rsquo;ll recall, the Falcons launched their franchise with <a href="news/2013/wk_4/index.php?team1=6&amp;team2=3&amp;h2h=true&amp;view=scores" target="_blank">five straight losses</a> to their natural rival before finally breaking through in 2012. Now, they have yet to <em>lose</em> again since winning that first one, taking the last three from the Bensons&hellip;all in relatively close affairs.<br/>
	<br/>
	We have a bona fide rivalry brewing in the East, folks.<br/>
	<br/>
	&ldquo;Priority number one is winning the Limo, always,&rdquo; Ian said to reporters, while cradling the Court-Ordered Limousine to his chest. &ldquo;But you could call beating the Bensons priority 1-b. I can&rsquo;t wait for Thanksgiving this year!&rdquo;<br/>
	<br/>
	In the irony of all ironies, the Falcons and Bensons actually play again <em>on Thanksgiving weekend.</em> How&rsquo;s that for fantastic scheduling? You&rsquo;re welcome.<br/>
	<br/>
	Turkey Day could be a joyous occasion indeed for Ian thanks to an exceedingly balanced attack. No player scored more than 23 in his 135-point weekend, but five players scored over 15.<br/>
	<br/>
	After a clunker in Week 1 &ndash; which they still won, thanks to being matched up against The Lawrence Football Jesus &ndash; the Falcons stayed above the century mark in each of the next three weeks. Only The Mighty Boom can say the same.<br/>
	<br/>
	So, after nearly a third of the season, a repeat JADDL champ seems like a real possibility for the first time in a long time. The odds are against it, of course, but <em>never tell Ian the odds.</em><br/>
	<br/>
	&hellip;Ha! I got a <em>Star Wars</em> reference in after all! Suck on that!
