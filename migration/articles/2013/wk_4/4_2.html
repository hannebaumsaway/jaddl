<div id="headline">Quickies: Week 4</div>
<div id="article">
	<div class="heading">Falcons</div>Well, what do you think? <em>Will</em> the Falcons ever lose again?!<br/>
	<div class="heading">IPA</div>Another week in the books, and IPA still has had the best luck in the West (in terms of points scored against them). That shouldn&rsquo;t take away from the fact that they&rsquo;ve also <em>scored</em> the most points in their division to date as well, though. And how&rsquo;s this for mitigating the effect of a bye week: Lannie plugged Philip &ldquo;One L&rdquo; Rivers for Cammy Cam, and Rivers put up 28 points.<br/>
	<br/>
	More good news for The Connoisseur: Arian Foster finally didn&rsquo;t suck this week.<br/>
	<div class="heading">Boom</div>I mean, what do we even say about Boom at this point? They&rsquo;re awesome. They are kicking ass without bothering to take names. Chuck Norris named his fantasy team &ndash; no, I&rsquo;m not going to that well. But really, what do we say? Boom has scored almost 90 more points than the closest competitor.<br/>
	<br />
	Jesus actually had a good week, eclipsing 100, and <em>still</em> lost to Boom by nearly 30. Shady McCoy finally failed to get to 15, but Matt Ryan, Matt Forte, Victor Cruz, and Jordan Cameron all picked him up. So the beat goes on.<br/>
	<div class="heading">Monkeys</div>Thank god. At last, we get to stop pretending the Monkeys are really good just because they&rsquo;re undefeated (thanks Lannie!). The Monkeys have put up the second fewest points in the West. Their RB corps is a complete fucking mess (McFadden? Lacy? <em>Snelling and Daniel Thomas?</em>).<br/>
	<div class="heading">Odouls</div>Here is a fun little math equation for you:<br />
<br />
	( PEYTON MANNING  +  SHITTY TEAMMATES )  -  FIGHTIN&rsquo; LONGSHANKS  =  WIN<br/>
	<div class="heading">Hauloll</div>Our resident bipolar buddy. Hauloll has yet to score between 80 and 110; it&rsquo;s been either above or below thus far. See what was said above for Odouls? Swap &ldquo;PEYTON MANNING&rdquo; for &ldquo;ADRIAN PETERSON&rdquo; and you&rsquo;d have a pretty valid equation for Jason&rsquo;s squad.<br/>
	<div class="heading">Bensons</div>Scoring 116 points and losing is a tough pill to swallow. Doing so against your natural rival brings the pill dangerously close to lodging in your throat. Such is the week Alex faces, despite a brilliant move in activating Le&rsquo;Veon Bell (is an apostrophe really necessary in that name?).<br />
<br />
	Unfortunately, the injury to Nate Burleson didn&rsquo;t give Ryan Broyles the boost Alex hoped for &ndash; you know, <em>anything above zero points</em> &ndash; and C.J. Spiller still hasn&rsquo;t done jack shit. Still, the East&rsquo;s wild card is still wide open.<br/>
	<div class="heading">Pursuit</div>Nolan can thank Drew Brees, Rashard Mendenhall, and Mike Wallace for the victory this week. And only one of those players is on his team.<br/>
	<div class="heading">Jesus</div>Jesus is showing signs of life! Sure, it came in a loss, but this game against Boom was marked as a loss a week ago. The important thing for LFJ is the fact that they proved capable of scoring a good number, with a little time left to go to work. Again, the East is still pretty wide open (read: shitty) since three teams sit at 1-3. If &ndash; <em>if</em> &ndash; Jesus can play closer to its Week 4 level as opposed to the level of previous weeks, the chase is still afoot.<br />
<br />
	For that to happen, however, Jesus will need someone other than a D/ST to be its leading scorer on a consistent basis.<br/>
	<div class="heading">Hornets</div>Tom Brady appears to be back on track, and Marshawn Lynch may be up and down, but when he&rsquo;s up, he&rsquo;s <em>way</em> up. The Hornets are going to have to avoid having four players under four points each to get beyond sucky outings like this week&rsquo;s, though. You read that right: four players under four points each. Ouch.<br/>
	<div class="heading">Longshanks</div>Remember when the Longshanks scored 153 points? Neither do the Longshanks. Teams like the &rsquo;Shanks do certain things to make them the way they are. Things like getting negative production from a wide receiver; benching a defense that would score zero points, only to put in a defense that scores two points; drafting a player in the first round who through four weeks would be statistically the worst skill position player on the team. You know, stuff like that.<br />
<br />
	But, once again, two other teams in the East are sitting with the &rsquo;Shanks at 1-3, and that 152-point game <em>did</em> happen, so maybe Ryan can rekindle the magic somehow.<br/>
	<div class="heading">Chumps</div>A decent week for OPC, thanks to Golden Antonio Gates and Anquan Boldin. Alas, it didn&rsquo;t matter, and the Chumps are still winless on the season. Well, they&rsquo;ll just have to go ahead and be the first 0-4 team to make the playoffs since&hellip;oh, wait, it&rsquo;s never happened.
