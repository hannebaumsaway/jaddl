	When the hour of the season is late, and you&rsquo;re sitting at .500, games against division rivals which also sit at .500 are amplified measurably.<br/>
	<br/>
	Win, and deal your key playoff competitor a two-game blow. Lose, and they do the same to you. And as the season draws to a close, opportunities to make deficits up become as precious&mdash;and scarce&mdash;as a well-executed mullet.<br/>
	<br/>
	That was the situation facing Team Hauloll this past weekend; 4-4, facing off against fellow 4-4 Westerner Tulsa. The IPA Connoisseur all but has a postseason spot secured at 7-2, but the other two spots in the West are up for grabs. In Pursuit of Perfection is 6-3 and in second at the moment. Throw in the Monkeys and Hauloll, and that makes three teams vying for two available spots in the Big Show.<br/>

	<br/>
	So yeah &hellip; when you get a square shot at one of those teams, you have to take advantage.<br/>
	<br/>
	And take advantage Hauloll did.<br/>
	<br/>
	Chris &ldquo;CJ1K&rdquo; Johnson (he ain&rsquo;t getting to 2K this year) led them to a 131.4&ndash;70.9 dismantling of the Monkeys with 24 points. Adrian Peterson and Russell Wilson pitched in with 24 and 22, respectively.<br/>
	<br/>
	This win ends a two-game skid for Hauloll&mdash;two weeks of getting rained on by the East&mdash;just in the nick of time. They also broke 100 for the first time since Week 4, and for just the third time overall.<br/>
	<br/>
	&ldquo;We hadn&rsquo;t been playing well enough to deserve to advance, obviously&rdquo; said Jason. &ldquo;But since when does <em>deserving</em> a playoff spot have anything to do with <em>getting</em> one?&rdquo;<br/>
	<br/>
	 Since never. That&rsquo;s why, despite Hauloll&rsquo;s lackluster play before this week, they find themselves controlling their own destiny from this point onward. With games coming up against the Red Hornets (2-7) and One Pump Chumps (1-8), Hauloll could &hellip; <em>should</em> &hellip; be 7-4 when it faces off against the West&rsquo;s front runner, IPA. The Monkeys have to face both IPA and IPP in that three-week stretch, so they&rsquo;ll have to bring their A-game to not be completely out of the hunt by the time they get the Hornets to close out the regular season.<br/>
	 <br/>
	 But Hauloll can&rsquo;t sit back and count on a Monkeys collapse. As the Hornets proved this past weekend when they came away with an improbable win over IPA, fantasy matchups aren&rsquo;t played on paper. Well &hellip; I mean, they <em>are</em> played on paper, but &hellip; oh, you know what I mean.
