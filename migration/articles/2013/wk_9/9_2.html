<div id="headline">Quickies: Week 9</div>
<div id="article">
	<div class="heading">Falcons</div>Jamaal Charles was held to single digits for the first time this year, and the Falcons contributed to muddying the East playoff race by giving Odouls a much-needed win. The Falcons&rsquo; own playoff aspirations are still in great shape, though they haven&rsquo;t clinched just yet.<br/>
	<div class="heading">IPA</div>The ramifications of #Vetogate deepened, as Arian Foster was an inactive active &hellip; as in, he was technically active, but didn&rsquo;t end up getting any carries. Ben Tate&rsquo;s eight points wouldn&rsquo;t have done IPA any good though, as they lost by 29 to the previously one-win Hornets.<br />
<br />
	With the Foster ordeal, a Darren Sproles injury, and bye weeks for Frank Gore and Julius Thomas, you get things like a 58-point total. And a loss.<br/>
	<div class="heading">Boom</div>Boom hasn&rsquo;t lost consecutive games within a season since Week 9 of 2011, and they weren&rsquo;t about to start now. Pete didn&rsquo;t let #Vetogate get him down; he gave a rousing pep talk that brought Gio Bernard&rsquo;s productivity back up, and Forte&mdash;the league&rsquo;s #2 back&mdash;continued to shine. The win kept Boom a game up on Odouls and BNB.<br/>
	<div class="heading">Pursuit</div>Nomac breathes a sigh of relief every night, knowing that the Ginger Prince (Andy Dalton) is just his <em>backup</em> QB. Drew Brees drives the bus for IPP. Alfred-o Morris had his best game of the season in the monumental win over OPC to stay safely in the fold in the West.<br/>
	<div class="heading">Odouls</div>For once, the Peyton Manning equation didn&rsquo;t hold! With Peyton on the bench with a bye, Odouls survived having to play Christian Steele-Ponder, thanks to an unlikely 30 points from Zac &ldquo;No K&rdquo; Stacy.<br />
<br />
	The win could not have come at a better time either, as it keeps Odouls&mdash;for the moment&mdash;ahead of the Bensons in the standings as we enter the home stretch.<br/>
	<div class="heading">Hauloll</div>Nick Foles may have put up 50 without Jason benefiting from it, but that&rsquo;s cool; Russell Wilson is doing just fine of late. They get Demaryius Thomas back from his bye next week also. (Do you really need both a &ldquo;y&rdquo; and an &ldquo;i&rdquo; in &ldquo;Demaryius&rdquo;?)<br/>
	<div class="heading">Bensons</div>Jordy Nelson treated his new owner to 26 points last week in his first game as a Benson, and BNB took home a win and the Briefly Badass. Nelson was held in check without Aaron Rodgers throwing to him this week, but it mattered not: the Bensons took home the Badass once again (the sixth time in JADDL history a team has won consecutive BBs) thanks primarily to a brilliant decision by Alex to use the two-headed tight end monster, Grahamkowski (46 points). And, once again, all those reasons a win was important for Hauloll hold true for BNB in its win over the Shanks, as well.<br/>
	<div class="heading">Monkeys</div>The loss to Hauloll was bad for the Monkeys for all the reasons it was <em>good</em> for Hauloll. RG3 is floundering, and with Megatron on his bye, so floundered the Monkeys. Could a change at QB be on the horizon in Tulsa?<br />
<br />
	&hellip; Alex Smith is Jacob&rsquo;s alternative, so no.<br/>
	<div class="heading">Longshanks</div>Three wins in a row were too much to ask for from a team with so many flaws&mdash;Ray Rice at the top of the list. With four starters on the bench with byes, against a team which has it rolling in the Bensons &hellip; yeah, the Shanks lost. And now their playoff hopes hang by a slowly unraveling cord.<br/>
	<div class="heading">Hornets</div>The losing streak is done at six! I would cite some Hornets stats for you, but let&rsquo;s face it: the Hornets&rsquo; MVP was its opponent, The IPA Connoisseur.<br/>
	<div class="heading">Jesus</div>LFJ has now lost four in a row to The Mighty Boom. They&rsquo;ve lost three straight and have failed to get above 70 in their last two. Trent Richardson has been an unmitigated disaster. But here&rsquo;s the good news:<br />
<br />
	Jesus hasn&rsquo;t been mathematically eliminated yet! (&hellip; I don&rsquo;t think.)<br/>
	<div class="heading">Chumps</div>When it rains, it pours, and it&rsquo;s been pouring on the Chumps all season. Now Aaron Rodgers is hurt, and even Spoiler Mode has become exceedingly difficult for OPC.
