	Uniforms are just uniforms, right? A team name is just something fans can refer to their beloved franchise by.<br/>
	<br/>
	This stuff is only relevant for merchandise sales, isn&rsquo;t that so?<br/>
	<br/>
	Maybe not.<br/>
	<br/>
	Back in the summer between the 2010 and 2011 seasons, Jacob had had enough. Enough of losing, enough of staying home for the holidays, enough of wistfully wondering what the playoffs must be like while burying his sadness in a package of Double Stuf Oreos.<br/>
	<br/>
	In that year&rsquo;s owners meeting, Jacob made an announcement on behalf of his franchise. &ldquo;The Flying Pigs are looking to make major changes this season after moving the team to Tulsa. I have decided to change our name and mascot, to get us out of the pink uniforms.&rdquo;<br/>
	<div class="news-quote">The flying pig is a metaphor for something that&rsquo;s never going to happen, and it represented my playoff hopes for too long.<div class="author">Jacob</div></div>
	<br/>
	Name changes were nothing new to the league, so Jacob&rsquo;s peers simply nodded politely, feigning interest.<br/>
	<br/>
	Then Jacob went a step further.<br/>
	<br/>
	&ldquo;My team is now the Angry Monkeys, and we will have our revenge this season by breaking into the playoffs.&rdquo;<br/>
	<br/>
	An awkward silence followed. The Pigs had never made the playoffs. They&rsquo;d never had a winning record. In four years of JADDL play, they had just one Briefly Badass to their name. One, in 52 weeks of action. They had the third worst lifetime winning percentage in the league, and on and on the list of Pigs failures went.<br/>
	<br/>
	So Jacob was making a bold claim.<br/>
	<br/>
	The name could change, the colors could change, the uniforms could change, and each year the roster would change. But the guy at the top would remain; the guy who drafted and managed all those horrific teams. Why would this franchise&rsquo;s fortunes be better in the future?<br/>
	<br/>
	Well, logic be damned: the makeover worked.<br/>
	<br/>
	From 2007 to 2010, the Flying Pigs went 19-33 and scored 82.3 points a game.<br/>
	<br/>
	Since 2011, the <em>Angry Monkeys</em> have gone 20-13 with a 94.7 average.<br/>
	<br/>
	&hellip; And they made the playoffs in both 2011 and 2012.<br/>
	<br/>
	It looks like 2013 may continue this rags-to-riches tale. The Monkeys are 4-3, back on the right side of .500 after a Chasm War victory over The Lawrence Football Jesus, 121.8&ndash;101.6. Robert Griffin got back to his version 3.0 self with 28 points, while Megatron recovered from his injury in time to plow over Jesus&mdash;like a robotic alien Mack truck&mdash;with 30 points of his own.<br/>
	<br/>
	Jacob knew what he was doing a couple years ago, apparently, even if he had no idea what he was doing before then.<br/>
	<br/>
	&ldquo;The flying pig is a metaphor for something that&rsquo;s never going to happen, and it represented my playoff hopes for too long. An angry monkey is something real, something you can see at the zoo or in a jungle. And an angry monkey is more dangerous than a flying pig. That&rsquo;s just science.&rdquo;<br/>
	<br/>
	We&rsquo;ll see if the Monkeys are angry enough to climb to the top of the logjam they find themselves in in the West standings. IPP and Team Hauloll are also 4-3, and all three are 3-2 in the division. Furthermore, they&rsquo;re all within two total points of each other, score-wise. That&rsquo;s crazy.<br/>
	<br/>
	You know what isn&rsquo;t crazy? Franchise makeovers, as it would happen.
