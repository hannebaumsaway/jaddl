<div id="headline">Quickies: Week 7</div>
<div id="article">
	<div class="heading">Falcons</div>The Falcons are one clunker away from being undefeated. They&rsquo;ve scored in the hundreds in five of the seven weeks, and they don&rsquo;t look to be slowing up any time soon.<br />
<br />
	Jamaal Charles is the number one back in the league, and Andrew Luck is definitely more Peyton Manning than Ryan Leaf (remember that guy?). Wes Welker flies under the radar, and he&rsquo;s the second best receiver in the fucking league.<br/>
	<div class="heading">IPA</div>The West should probably beware: Cammy Cam hasn&rsquo;t turned the ball over in two weeks, and looks to be just now hitting his stride. Oh, and there appears to be some juice left in Frank Gore&rsquo;s old balls after all. Julius Thomas continues to suck at the Peyton teat, and Lannie continues to suck at Lady Luck&rsquo;s teat; five of his seven opponents scored below their season averages against him.<br/>
	<div class="heading">Boom</div>Okay, everyone relax. The world is back on its axis after two strange weeks in which Boom failed to get to 100. All it took was three touches from Matt Forte.<br />
<br />
	And yes &hellip; Boom is statistically the best 5-2 team ever.<br/>
	<div class="heading">Pursuit</div>Any time you get nearly 30 points from the Ginger Prince, Andy Dalton, and <em>lose</em> &hellip; well, you aren&rsquo;t going to be happy about it. Boom-or-bust DeSean Jackson switched to bust at the wrong time, and IPP dropped a very winnable interdivision game, keeping them from escaping the 4-3 pileup in the West.<br/>
	<div class="heading">Odouls</div>Remember our little equation?<br />
<br />
	( PEYTON MANNING  +  SHITTY TEAMMATES )  -  OPPONENT  =  WIN<br />
<br />
	Peyton was held in check in Week 6, and Odouls lost. He climbed back over 25 in Week 7, and behold, an Odouls victory!<br/>
	<div class="heading">Monkeys</div>The Tulsa Tree-Swingers played an inactive player (Brandon Jacobs) and not only survived the weekend; they won the Briefly Badass. Life is good in Tulsa town at the moment.<br/>
	<div class="heading">Bensons</div>Alex&rsquo;s short winning streak and longer 100-point streak were both snapped, but he isn&rsquo;t crying over Spiller&rsquo;d milk. He&rsquo;s making moves, as Alex is wont to do. Will his blockbuster trade with the Hornets&mdash;Spiller, Woodhead, Pryor, and Woods, for Jordy Nelson and Big Ben&mdash;trigger a second half surge or a slow and agonizing descent into playofflessness?<br/>
	<div class="heading">Hauloll</div>Hauloll rode a dinghy and hopped aboard the H.M.S. Nick Foles, and it promptly smashed into an iceberg. In fairness, Jason&rsquo;s other choice was Eli Manning.<br />
<br />
	So, it&rsquo;s fair to say Jason has a quarterback problem.<br/>
	<div class="heading">Longshanks</div>Well, well, well. Consecutive wins? That&rsquo;s the first time the Shanks have accomplished that since the end of &rsquo;11. And this is the first time the Shanks have <em>ever</em> had a winning record in the Chasm War. Kaepernick managed to eclipse 15 the past two weeks, and AJ Green is suddenly the league&rsquo;s top receiver. Reggie Bush continues to be quietly effective, but it&rsquo;s still doubtful the Shanks will be able to survive the Ray Rice debacle in the long term.<br/>
	<div class="heading">Hornets</div>Five losses in a row. Five games under 90 points (three of them under 80). All that, and the Hornets are still managing to trend downward from where they were a few weeks ago. Tom Brady can bitch about his WR corps all he wants; the fact of the matter is, he&rsquo;s not getting it done. That leaves Dan with Marshawn Lynch, Jordy Nelson, and a pile of garbage.<br/>
	<div class="heading">Jesus</div>As James himself so eloquently put it: &ldquo;1st 3 wks: 70.5, 71.7& 67.2 &hellip; Record: 1-2 &hellip; Next 4 wks: 102.2, 118.6, 93.3 & 101.6 &hellip; Record: 1-3 &hellip; So whatever.&rdquo;<br/>
	<div class="heading">Chumps</div>When Jesse drafted Aaron Rodgers fourth overall, he was banking on Rodgers overwhelming stat sheets like he has in the past. Well, Rodgers is currently just the seventh best QB in the league, and thus, OPC is where it is: in spoiler mode.
