	You won&rsquo;t find ESPN coating SportsCenter with wall-to-wall highlights of this game, annually.<br/>
	<br/>
	It doesn&rsquo;t usually set fans of either franchise all a-titter on Twitter in the days leading up to the main event.<br/>
	<br/>
	In the league-wide survey distributed to front offices in 2011, neither owner considered the other a rival with any sort of vitriol.<br/>
	<br/>
	But make no mistake: this is a rivalry.<br/>
	<br/>
	Why? Because crazy shit always seems to happen in this game, that&rsquo;s why.<br/>
	<br/>
	I&rsquo;m talking, of course, about The Lawrence Football Jesus versus Team Odouls. It&rsquo;s the rivalry in the East you rarely hear about. But you really should make it a point to follow it. Because, like I said: crazy shit happens in these matchups.<br/>
	<br/>
	In 2010, it took the <a href="news/2013/wk_5/index.php?view=news&amp;yr=2010&amp;wk=wk_2&amp;pg=2" target="_blank">insane combination</a> of a two-point conversion in the final two minutes of regulation, a coin toss, and a game-winning field goal in overtime for Jesus to erase a 10-point Monday night deficit to edge Odouls.<br/>
	<br/>
	And that was a <em>revenge</em> game.<br/>
	<br/>
	The year before, Jesus was victimized by those fun little mid-week scoring adjustments ESPN sometimes likes to pull.<br/>
	<br/>
	When the dust had settled on their 2009 battle, Jesus fans rejoiced at a victory over Team Odouls &hellip; a victory by nine tenths of a point.<br/>
	<br/>
	Tuesday morning brought something other than joy in Lawrence, however. Overnight, ESPN decided Cardinals runningback Tim Hightower &ndash; remember that guy? &ndash; deserved one more point than he was originally given. Odouls owned Hightower at the time. Thus, Odouls ended up the victor by the smallest margin possible: a tenth of a point.<br/>
	<br/>
	Later, another adjustment gave Odouls yet another point, meaning the game is in the books forever as a 1.1-point win for Odouls. But <a href="news/2013/wk_5/index.php?view=news&amp;yr=2009&amp;wk=wk_7&amp;pg=2" target="_blank">the legend will live on regardless</a>.<br/>
	<br/>
	In 2011, the second Jesus/Odouls game of that year can be summed up by a single NFL game: the Chiefs versus the Dolphins. The Chiefs were drilled in the contest, 31&ndash;3. Both the 31 and the 3 were supremely significant to Jesus and Odouls. The 3 was a Ryan Succop field goal, which gave Odouls four points. The 31 from Miami whittled the Chiefs D/ST score to -4 &hellip; and naturally, Jesus started the Chiefs D/ST that week. Without the Chiefs/Dolphins game, Jesus has itself a five-point victory. With it, Odouls won by three.<br/>
	<br/>
	I swear to god I&rsquo;m not making this up. Look it up, see for yourselves.<br/>
	<br/>
	Now, in 2013, we have another story for the darkening saga of Odouls v. Jesus.<br/>
	<br/>
	Think of this one as a kind of mix between the comeback heroics seen in the 2010 affair and the scoring adjustment nightmare of 2009.<br/>
	<br/>
	Jesus went into Monday Night Football once again needing some magic from involved players to overcome a significant deficit. And magic they got. The Falcons &ndash; a team who suddenly can&rsquo;t run the ball for shit &ndash; called Jacquizz Rodgers&rsquo; number in the red zone twice, and he delivered two touchdowns for the Football Jesus. Tony Gonzalez didn&rsquo;t reach paydirt, but he did rack up 97 yards and 9.7 points of his own. Bilal Powell pitched in a measly 4.7, but in all, Jesus had itself 32.2 shiny new points to work with.<br/>
	<br/>
	And with about 1:30 left in the game, Jesus suddenly had a lead. A lead by 2.3, but a lead nonetheless. A long climb, a hard journey, and a triumphant finish. Right?<br/>
	<br/>
	That&rsquo;s where the fairy tale ends for ol&rsquo; Jesus. Old Testament type brutality took over in the form of a game-winning drive by the New York fucking Jets. The resultant <em>J-E-T-S Jets! Jets! Jets!</em> field goal dropped the Falcons D/ST score from 3 &hellip; to zero.<br/>
	<br/>
	&hellip; Which dropped Jesus&rsquo; score to 0.7 behind Odouls.<br/>
	<br/>
	There&rsquo;s still a chance ESPN could pull its adjustment shenanigans once again, this time to the benefit of LFJ. But it&rsquo;s not likely.<br/>
	<br/>
	What <em>is</em> likely is that we&rsquo;re going to continue to get crazy outcomes from Odouls/Jesus games for years to come.<br/>
	<br/>
	So when this game comes back around on the calendar, pay attention.
