	You don&rsquo;t want to go 1-4. Period.<br/>
	<br/>
	I mean, that&rsquo;s a bit of an obvious statement, but 1-4 is probably more damning than you even imagined. You probably thought, <em>Well, 1-4 would suck, but you could come back from that!</em><br/>
	<br/>
	Wrong, bitch.<br/>
	<br/>
	At least, wrong so far. The next time a 1-4 team recovers quickly and substantially enough to make the playoffs, it&rsquo;ll be the first time.<br/>
	<br/>
	So that&rsquo;s what The Bad News Bensons and Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks faced this past weekend: the prospect of watching their season wither and die even before interdivisional play began. Harnessing the survivalist rage that comes with being backed into a corner, both teams came ready to play.<br/>
	<br/>
	And that makes the Bensons&rsquo; 139.5&ndash;99.7 victory all the more impressive. The Shanks have been laying down of late, posting under 75 each of the previous three weeks. So when they checked in right at a hundred, it would&rsquo;ve been reasonable to expect a win to accompany their score. BNB not only survived the Longshanks&rsquo; volley; they thrived amongst it.<br/>
	<br/>
	With Megatron sidelined, Alex worried that Matthew Stafford may struggle. So, in an inspired stroke, he swapped Stafford for league newcomer Terrelle Pryor. You know Pryor; he&rsquo;s the guy who got Jim Tressel fired at Ohio State.<br/>
	<br/>
	Well, Pryor isn&rsquo;t getting Alex to fire himself anytime soon, after he put up 21.9 in his spot start. Alex has indicated the JADDL may be seeing more of Pryor in the coming weeks, as well.<br/>
	<div class="news-quote">It was a must-win game for us. We broke out all the tricks.<div class="author">Alex</div></div>
	<br/>
	&ldquo;Terrelle looks good in BNB blue. He&rsquo;s going to get more looks against favorable match-ups.&rdquo;<br/>
	<br/>
	The Pryor find came at a great time in this must-win situation, but he wasn&rsquo;t even the biggest surprise of the week. That honor belongs to wide receiver T.Y. Hilton, whom this reporter called &ldquo;Ty&rdquo; for half the off-season before realizing it was actually an acronym.<br/>
	<br/>
	Hilton exploded for 28 points on 140 yards receiving with two touchdowns tacked on. This came after three disappointing outings in the Bensons&rsquo; first four games. Needless to say, Hilton was not on the Shanks&rsquo; radar, defensively. &ldquo;Who is Ty Hilton?&rdquo; Ryan complained after the game. &ldquo;No, really, who the fuck is Ty Hilton? Does anyone know?&rdquo;<br/>
	<br/>
	Bad News got solid contributions pretty much across the board, including Knowshon Moreno&rsquo;s continued improbable productivity. The same Moreno whom Ryan claimed he would &ldquo;never again draft, even in the sixteenth round&rdquo; back in August. This game had to feel good for Moreno, considering.<br/>
	<br/>
	So now the Bensons find themselves 2-3 with a vastly better outlook than they would have had had they lost this game. They do still have work to do, however, starting with interdivision play over the next three weekends. The schedule didn&rsquo;t do them any favors, as they&rsquo;re paired up against the West&rsquo;s top two scoring teams in The IPA Connoisseur and Team Hauloll. But the Bensons have won their own division twice before; they know how to win, and they know how to win when it counts.<br/>
	<br/>
	2-3 teams go on to make the postseason 17% of the time, so the climb is still an uphill one. But that&rsquo;s a climb the Bensons are happy to take on.<br/>
	<br/>
	&ldquo;It was a must-win game for us. We broke out all the tricks, like the powder blue [alternate uniforms].&rdquo;
