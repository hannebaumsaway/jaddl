	Sooner or later, the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks were <i>going</i> to win. It was <i>going</i> to happen, people. No team loses forever.<br/>
	<br/>
	But it&rsquo;s doubtful anyone saw this particular game coming.<br/>
	<br/>
	Before this past weekend, as you probably know&mdash;and if you didn&rsquo;t know, you haven&rsquo;t been listening to James&mdash;the &rsquo;Shanks were riding a 12-game losing streak; the longest such streak in JADDL history. Additionally, the &rsquo;Shanks had lost four straight&mdash;and six of its last seven&mdash;to The Mighty Boom.<br/>

	<br/>
	And aside from the numbers, Boom is the most storied franchise in the league, while the only thing storied about the Longshanks in recent memory has been its incompetence.<br/>
	<br/>
	Thus, in classic JADDL fashion, the &rsquo;Shanks blew up&hellip;and blew out Boom 153.2&ndash;125.5. Of <i>course</i> they did. Surprises like that are what keep you coming back for more.<br/>
	<br/>
	When the 2013 schedule was released in August, Longshanks fans looked at who they were matched up against in Week 1 and mentally moved on, hoping the &rsquo;Shanks could end their losing streak at 13 with a win over the defending champion Millennium Falcons. After all, the last time the &rsquo;Shanks and Boom met on the field, Boom humiliated the &rsquo;Shanks as much as can be imagined, hanging 188.9 on them in a 95.8-point rout.<br/>
	<br/>
	That day, Boom set a league record for points in a game. No league record was set this time around, but the Longshanks did set a <i>franchise</i> record with their 153.2 points, and that was more than enough to satisfy everyone sporting the white and blue.<br/>
	<br/>
	&ldquo;Pete can keep his stacked trophy case, league records, and throngs of fans,&rdquo; said Ryan. &ldquo;We have scoreboard.&rdquo;<br/>
	<br/>
	The Longshanks laid claim to scoreboard primarily behind the efforts of Colin Kaepernick (30.6) and A.J. Green (30.2), but it was Reggie Bush who perhaps pleased the franchise&rsquo;s front office the most with his 27.1 points. Bush was considered by many to be a risky pick in the third round, considering his inconsistent past. But after one week of action, it looks like Detroit is going to focus on Bush in their offense a great deal, and that has &rsquo;Shanks fans breathing a sigh of relief.<br/>
	<br/>
	Said one fan: &ldquo;We were worried about the Bush pick, no doubt. DeMarco Murray was still on the board, and most of us were clamoring for him. Besides, most of us think our GM is an idiot, and we just assume he&rsquo;ll make the wrong move. The guy drafted Darren McFadden in the first round last year, for fuck&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;<br/>
	<br/>
	Speaking of the draft, it&rsquo;s worth noting that Kaepernick was still on the board this year when The Mighty Boom selected Matt Ryan. Kaepernick went four picks later to the Longshanks.<br/>
	<br/>
	&ldquo;I have  a sick feeling that choosing Ryan over Kaepernick is going to haunt me all year long,&rdquo; admitted Peter following the game. (True story, he really said that.)<br/>
	<br/>
	Now, before &rsquo;Shanks fans start planning for the parade, a little perspective is in order&hellip;<br/>
	<br/>
	The &rsquo;Shanks <i>always</i> start well. Before this most recent game, they were second in the league in Week 1 points (behind Boom). Now, obviously, the &rsquo;Shanks are numero uno in that category. Week 1 is far and away the Longshanks&rsquo; best week. After that, it&rsquo;s a sharp drop-off: their average score declines by nearly 20 points beyond the first week.<br/>
	<br/>
	Hell, the &rsquo;Shanks won in Week 1 a year ago over the eventual champs&hellip;and proceeded to lose 12 straight.<br/>
	<br/>
	Considering the output the &rsquo;Shanks produced this game&mdash;including that from its bench&mdash;it&rsquo;s unlikely another lengthy losing streak is in order. But forgive fans if they approach 2013 with a wait-and-see attitude even after this most impressive start.
