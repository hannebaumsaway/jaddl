<div class="tagline">What Week 1 really means</div>
<div id="article">
	This week, the losers of this past weekend&rsquo;s games have been consoling themselves with the mantra, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just one week,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long season, guys!&rdquo;<br/>
	<br/>
	On the flip side, the winners have been tempering their own expectations in a similar fashion, reminding their giddy fans that one week does not a season make.<br/>
	<br/>
	Or does it?<br/>
	<br/>
	Let&rsquo;s take a look at what Week 1 has meant for its winners and losers, historically. Winners first!<br/>
	<br/>
	Over the past six seasons, 36 teams have emerged from the opening weekend victorious. Of those 36 teams, 26 went on to make the playoffs&mdash;eight made the quarterfinals, 11 the semis, and seven marched all the way to the Jared Bowl.<br/>
	<br/>
	So, that&rsquo;s a 72% clip for Week 1 victors earning postseason berths.<br/>
	<br/>
	For the losers, the picture is much grimmer, as you would expect. In fact, if you remember any algebra from high school, you already know the numbers for the losers&hellip;they&rsquo;re the exact opposite.<br/>
	<br/>
	Just 28% of the Week 1 losers ended up making the playoffs&mdash;10 teams. If you&rsquo;re looking for a ray of hope, losers, five of those 10 teams did make it all the way to the Jared Bowl. So, you know&hellip;keep fighting, and stuff.<br/>
	<br/>
	And now a note for James in particular: there were two teams that <em>tied</em> in the opening weekend of the 2007 season&hellip;neither made the playoffs. So we&rsquo;ll go ahead and estimate the chances for a team who ties at a firm 0%.<br/>
	<br/>
	On a side note, defending champions are 4-2-1 in the opening weekend following their titles. What does that mean? Absolutely nothing. But I looked it up, so I figured I may as well share it.
