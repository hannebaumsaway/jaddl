	2012 was a high mark for the Lawrence Football Jesus franchise. The most wins for them in JADDL play (9); the most points (1,251.4); a playoff berth.<br/>
	<br/>
	Unless Jesus averages 167 points over these final two games, 2013 won&rsquo;t boast any of those things.<br/>
	<br/>
	But that&rsquo;s okay! 2013 legitimizes Jesus in a different way. A way that says, <em>Hey, our bad years now aren&rsquo;t </em>that<em> bad anymore.</em> Jesus could still score the second or third most points in franchise history this year, and could feasibly finish with a 6-7 record and once again out of the East&rsquo;s cellar (they haven&rsquo;t finished in last place since 2010).<br/>
	<br/>
	For a franchise that finished last or next to last in three of its first four years in the league, having down years that are just mediocre instead of awful is a good feeling.<br/>

	<br/>
	Consistency is a key going forward for the Pigskin Prophets. Avoiding those tragic games that are remembered for all the wrong reasons, and having the ability to hit a big game against any opponent in any given week. In 2007, Jesus scored less than 60 <em>six times.</em> They did it twice in both 2010 and 2011. This year? None, so far.<br/>
	<br/>
	The most times Jesus has scored 100+ in a single season is four, which they did in 2009 and 2012. They&rsquo;ve already accomplished the feat four times this year, so they&rsquo;ll have two chances to raise that particular bar. One of the ones already in the bag was this past weekend's 101.9&ndash;86.4 win over the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks, completing a sweep of that flailing franchise for the third straight season, beating them for the sixth straight time overall. This follows the Shanks&rsquo; own six-game winning streak over Jesus in the first four years of JADDL play. Turnabout clearly is fair play.<br/>
	<br/>
	James is pleased with the increasing respect his squad is receiving from his peers. &ldquo;There was a time when other owners would pat me on the back for winning four games in a season. This year, I&rsquo;m getting sympathetic looks and comments about next year. That psychological shift is invaluable to me.&rdquo;<br/>
	<br/>
	Another thing that may be invaluable to Jesus is momentum. If they can win their final two games&mdash;which would be no small feat, considering they play the Bensons (7-4) and Odouls (6-5)&mdash;they would carry a four-game winning streak into 2014, and <em>could</em> finish fourth in their division &hellip; though fifth seems all but locked in at this point.<br/>
	<br/>
	Either way, this is a season a franchise can build on. It isn&rsquo;t flashy, and it won&rsquo;t be spoken of fondly by LFJ fans for years to come. But a 1- or 2-win season <em>would</em> have been, for all the wrong reasons. It could have been disastrous, destroying everything positive that was gained the past two seasons.<br/>
	<br/>
	Disaster: averted.
