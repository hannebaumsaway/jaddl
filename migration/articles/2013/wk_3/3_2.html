<div id="article">
	In a shocking development this past weekend, a league general manager neglected to bench a player on his roster who was officially ruled out for his coming game. This is the first such instance since Red Hornets owner/GM Dan Romans was <a href="news/2013/wk_3/index.php?view=news&amp;yr=2011&amp;wk=wk_1&amp;pg=3">cited back in 2011</a>.<br/>
	<br/>
	The controversy this year centered around Reggie Bush being activated despite the Lions announcing Sunday morning that Bush would not be available. This time around, the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks front office was the culprit, a fact which makes the league&rsquo;s warning a bit of an awkward situation, considering the Longshanks&rsquo;&hellip;uh&hellip;<em>close association</em> with the league office.<br/>
	<br/>
	Nonetheless, a warning was indeed given, according to an offcial statement from the desk of the commissioner on Tuesday morning:<br/>
	<br/><div style="margin-left: 16px; padding-left: 4px; border-left: 1px solid #ccc;">
		<em>We can confirm that the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks franchise has been cited for unacceptable negligence and failure to uphold the standards of the Jared Allen&rsquo;s Designated Drivers League. Because this is a first offense, no further action will be taken against the franchise at this time. However, future violations will result in repercussions, likely monetary and/or humiliating in nature.</em>

	<br/>
	The league may wait for another offense to humiliate the Longshanks, but peer front offices are not.<br/>
	<br/>
	On Sunday morning, The Mighty Boom&rsquo;s people tweeted, &ldquo;Its amateur hour over @FightinShanks. Bush? Really?&rdquo;<br/>
	<br/>
	More tweets were quickly added to the pile. &ldquo;Is he throwing the game?&rdquo; from The Bad News Bensons front office. &ldquo;He was not going to play, it was common knowledge. You are exactly what I needed&rdquo; from that week&rsquo;s opponent, Lawrence Football Jesus. &ldquo;Mountain time like&rdquo; from In Pursuit of Perfection out of the West. And more.<br/>
	<br/>
	Then came salvos from The DDL.<br/>
	<br/>
	There was a <a href="http://jaddl.tumblr.com/post/61995214202/am-i-right-signed-bnb" target="_blank">satircal chart of Longshanks losses</a> in relation to the use of Reddit for fantasy football news. There were <a href="http://jaddl.tumblr.com/post/61995575027/everyone-except-reddit-ryan-hannebaum-and-his" target="_blank">screenshots</a>.

	<br/>
	So what explanation did the Longshanks organization have for this fuck-up of epic* proportions?<br/>
	<br/>
	&ldquo;&hellip;been painting Babyshanks&rsquo; room all day with the father-in-law, so fuck right off&rdquo; read the tweet from &rsquo;Shanks GM Ryan Hannebaum, when he was alerted to the snafu on Sunday.<br/>
	<br/>
	<em>Where are your priorities?</em> cried Longshanks fans everywhere. <em>Are we not family too? Do you care nothing for us?</em><br/>
	<br/>
	The Longshanks&rsquo; front office did issue an apology on Tuesday morning, but actions speak louder than words. &ldquo;I have let Longshanks Nation down. I can be better. I will be better&rdquo; were the words.<br/>
	<br/>
	Now let&rsquo;s see the actions.<br/>
	<br/>
	<sub>* &ldquo;epic&rdquo; because the roster mismanagement actually cost the Longshanks the game
