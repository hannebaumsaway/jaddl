<div id="headline">Quickies: Week 3</div>
<div id="article">
	<div class="heading">IPA</div>Welcome back, Cammy Cam Juice! Newton put up 31 for IPA in a big win over perennial West powerhouse Team Hauloll. That was enough to temporarily shield a looming issue for The Connoisseur: Arian Foster. Foster is just the 18th ranked RB heading into Week 4. If he spent more time fighting for extra yardage on the field than making up shit about starving in college because he was too poor to eat &ndash; hello, training table &ndash; IPA would be in serious business.<br/>
	<br/>
	But hey, they&rsquo;ve gotten to 3-0 largely without him or any semblance of a WR corps, so what do I know? Of course, that could be due to the fact that IPA has had the least points scored <em>against</em> them in the West to date&hellip;<br/>
	<div class="heading">Falcons</div>Gotta love those Kansas City Chiefs, right Ian? After all, Jamaal Charles &ndash; the #2-ranked RB in the JADDL &ndash; is carrying the Falcons so far. Well, he and Matt Prater.<br/>
	<br/>
	You won&rsquo;t find anyone complaining about their 3-0 record, but behind closed doors at Falcons HQ, there are nervous whispers acknowledging the fact that they&rsquo;re just fourth in the East in points scored despite the lofty win-loss record. Paper tigers, perhaps?<br/>
	<div class="heading">Monkeys</div>Speaking of paper tigers, let&rsquo;s talk about the Tulsa Angry Monkeys. The Monkeys also boast a shiny undefeated mark to date, but that isn&rsquo;t going to last unless they get their production up. Only three teams in the entire league have scored fewer points than Tulsa. When you get back-to-back opponents to put up 77 points and change, though, you can slide by unscathed.<br/>
	<br/>
	Eddie Lacy has been a huge bust thus far, but McFadden has been somewhat of a pleasant surprise. The Monkeys&rsquo; WR corps is a clusterfuck other than one guy, but that one guy is Megatron. In short: the jury is very much still out on this team.<br/>
	<div class="heading">Boom</div>In classic Boom fashion, The Mighty currently have <em>seven</em> players stowed away on their roster who are top 10 in their respective positions. The bench doesn&rsquo;t appear to be very deep for Boom, but they don&rsquo;t need it to be just yet.<br/>
	<div class="heading">Hornets</div>The Hornets, believe it or not, are the opposite of a paper tiger, whatever that is&hellip;&ldquo;lead lion,&rdquo; maybe? Anyway, the &rsquo;Nets have scored the most points in their division, yet have suffered two losses already.<br/>
	<br/>
	At least, that&rsquo;s the story on the surface. Underneath, you&rsquo;ll see that the Hornets&rsquo; point total is lofty only because of their Week 2 outburst (151.8). They&rsquo;ve been under 80 the other two weeks. Tom Brady has been pedestrian at best, and the Hornets currently have Rashard Mendenhall in their starting lineup, despite it not being 2010.<br/>
	<div class="heading">Odouls</div>Odouls has Peyton Manning. Everything else about them is irrelevant until further notice.<br/>
	<div class="heading">Bensons</div>Perhaps we should start referring to the Bensons as &ldquo;The Stash.&rdquo; They&rsquo;ve got Le&rsquo;Veon Bell, Isaiah Pead, The Gronk, and Ryan Broyles all <em>stashed</em> away for a second-half surge &ndash; at least that&rsquo;s Alex&rsquo;s plan.<br/>
	<br/>
	In the meantime, it&rsquo;d sure be nice for them if C.J. Spiller and T.Y. Hilton stopped sucking. Hmm&hellip;maybe the Bensons should have shied away from players with acronymous names.<br/>
	<div class="heading">Hauloll</div>Look at Michael Vick go!!! &hellip;For now. &hellip;Until he breaks. &hellip;Like he always does.<br/>
	<br/>
	But in that event, Hauloll still has Adrian Peterson. And then an alarmingly steep drop-off after that&hellip;<br/>
	<div class="heading">Pursuit</div>Don&rsquo;t sleep on IPP, folks. They have the third most points in their division and are picking up steam. 90. 95. 112. The arrow is pointed firmly upward, as Todd Haley would write on a napkin at a bar. The main worry for IPP at this point is DeSean Jackson losing momentum because a) defensive coordinators continue to &ldquo;figure out&rdquo; Chip Kelly&rsquo;s scheme, and/or b) Michael Vick breaks.<br/>
	<div class="heading">Jesus</div>Jesus is playing to its strength, which is scoring the fewest points in the league. Stevan Ridley has, uh, not worked out, and now he&rsquo;s about to be shipped to East rival The Bad News Bensons in return for Bilal Powell, who probably also won&rsquo;t work out because his name is fucking Bilal.<br/>
	<div class="heading">Longshanks</div><em>See:</em> <a href="news/2013/wk_3/index.php?view=news&amp;yr=2013&amp;wk=wk_3&amp;pg=2">here</a>.<br/>
	<div class="heading">Chumps</div>OPC is neither a paper tiger nor a lead lion&trade;; they&rsquo;re exactly where they should be: dead last in the standings, because they&rsquo;re dead last in points scored in the West. Aaron Rodgers is doing great &ndash; hooray! But god knows how badly Jesse fucked the rest of his roster by reaching up to take Rodgers <em>with the fourth overall pick in the draft</em>.
