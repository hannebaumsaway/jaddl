	For Peter, I&rsquo;m sure this never, ever gets old.<br/>
	<br/>
	For everyone else &ndash; particularly in the East &ndash; The Mighty Boom&rsquo;s winning ways wore out their welcome years ago.<br/>
	<br/>
	For fun, let&rsquo;s pull up some highlights from Boom&rsquo;s previous feature articles&hellip;<br/>
	<br/>
	2008: <em>&ldquo;It looks like The Mighty Boom has all the potential in the world to make a run at [perfection].&rdquo;</em><br/>
	<br/>
	2010: <em>&ldquo;Hey Pete: </em>enough<em> already. Seriously, this whole &lsquo;Hey, look how good I am!&rsquo; schtick is beyond old. We get it: you&rsquo;re incredibly dominant in the regular season.&rdquo;</em><br/>
	<br/>
	2011: <em>&ldquo;Since those dark days [of 2007], it&rsquo;s primarily been sunshine and lollipops for Boom as they earned their Mighty moniker.&rdquo; &hellip; &ldquo;The Boomers are bad motha fuckas once again.&rdquo;</em><br/>
	<br/>
	2012: <em>&ldquo;Since the birth of divisions&hellip;no team has spent more time at the top of its respective division than The Mighty Boom. This surely comes as a shock to no one.&rdquo; &hellip; &ldquo;Here we sit again. The whole &lsquo;Bizarro JADDL&rsquo; thing was cute while it lasted, but The Mighty have reclaimed their special first place seat in the JADDL theatre.&rdquo;</em><br/>

	<br/>
	You get the picture. Boom is good, and has been good for a very long time. They&rsquo;ve pretty much been good every year except 2007, and that year they were rebuilding after winning it all in &rsquo;06.<br/>
	<br/>
	But even good teams have ups and downs. Boom tends to start the season on a high note, when you consider the fact that they&rsquo;ve <em>never</em> had a losing record after three weeks in JADDL history. The closest they&rsquo;ve come to stumbling out of the gate was that infamous 2007 season, in which Boom still managed an even record after three weeks (1-1-1).<br/>
	<br/>
	So what Boom is doing this year in terms of wins and losses should come as no surprise. What should scare the Football Bejeezus (ha!) out of everyone is the fact that Boom has never started this well in terms of <em>points.</em> Actually, <em>no one</em> has, ever. Boom just set the high mark for points scored in the first three weeks of a season (379.9), a mark that was previously held by&hellip;The Mighty Boom.<br/>
	<br/>
	If you didn&rsquo;t see that one coming, you haven&rsquo;t been paying attention.<br/>
	<br/>
	So Boom is good. And they were great this past weekend, turning back a solid effort from The Bad News Bensons with an outstanding effort of their own in a 145.9&ndash;109.2 victory. After the game, Peter shed a little light on his 2013 strategy.<br/>
	<br/>
	&ldquo;You know I always have something up my sleeve for my opponents. This year, as you can see, I plan to unleash hell on the East in the form of the mighty Cleveland Browns!&rdquo;<br/>
	<br/>
	&hellip;Wait a sec&hellip;<br/>
	<br/>
	Yeah. It turns out that was a solid plan, for this week anyway. Boom got 49.4 points from his two Browns, Josh Gordon and Jordan Cameron. Do you recall Peter bragging about his Cameron pickup in the ninth round of the draft? He&rsquo;s now the #2 tight end in the league.<br/>
	<br/>
	Winning. Mind-fucking the rest of the league.<br/>
	<br/>
	That&rsquo;s what Pete do.
