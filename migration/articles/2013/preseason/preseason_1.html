	JADDL general managers will do just about anything to etch their names on the Court-Ordered Limousine at then end of the season.
<br/>	
<br/>	Case in point: Ian chose Jamaal Charles to spearhead his title defense. If you weren&rsquo;t aware, Ian is a Denver Broncos fan. Clearly, the JADDL has already surpassed the NFL among Ian&rsquo;s loyalties, despite Ian joining the league six years after its original birth.
<br/>	
<br/>	
This has been discussed before, but Ian&rsquo;s Millennium Falcons have secured the distinction of the most successful expansion franchise in league history. The others who came before barely emitted a whimper before slinking away. The Falcons, on the other hand, marched right in and won five games in their first season.
<br/>	
<br/>	Progression since then has been distinctly linear, in the right direction: six wins in 2010; seven in 2011; eight in 2012.
<br/>	
<br/>	The eight wins weren&rsquo;t enough for Ian last year, though. He took his team to the postseason (for the third consecutive year) and right through it, all the way to Jared Bowl VI, where his Falcons crushed Team Hauloll 103.2&ndash;71.7.
<br/>	
<br/>	So Ian&rsquo;s JADDL career can&rsquo;t be described as anything other than a success thus far. But shouldn&rsquo;t we have seen this coming?
<br/>	
<br/>	Yes, if you believe actual football experience aids one&rsquo;s fantasy career. Ian played <i>BCS-level college football</i>, if you recall.
<br/>	
<br/>	The other owners in the JADDL? Well, Pete and Dan played high school football through their senior year if memory serves. Lannie, Jacob, and Jason went to like 1A schools, so whatever they did doesn&rsquo;t really count. Ryan bowed out after his sophomore season when he realized there wasn&rsquo;t much of a market for slow receivers, weak tight ends, or statuesque quarterbacks in an option system. Jesse was down on the field in high school&hellip;but as a mascot.
<br/>	
<br/>	Anyway, the point is, Ian <i>should</i> be good at this. Football runs in his blood like alcohol used to run through Jared Allen&rsquo;s.
<br/>
<br/>	Then again, maybe fantasy football is to actual football players what <i>Guitar Hero</i> is to actual guitar players. Guitarists <a target="_blank" href="http://youtu.be/1juW3dDQ968?t=8s">commonly suck balls at <i>Guitar Hero</i></a> because they try to play that plastic faux-guitar as if it were the real thing, instead of the glorified XBox controller it is.
<br/>
<br/>	Maybe football players try to build fantasy teams as if the game were actually played on the field, instead of in a <a target="_blank" href="http://youtu.be/CTjolEUj00g">sequence of ones and zeros</a> on a Linux server in Bristol, CT.
<br/>
<br/>	However, early returns suggest that football experience does indeed lead to fantasy glory. Hell, it already has for Ian, once.
<br/>	
<br/>	With that in mind, perhaps we&rsquo;ll finally see a repeat champion. The Falcons have as good a chance as any previous champ, at least. Will they cash in on it (both figuratively and literally)? We&rsquo;ll know in a little over 16 weeks.
