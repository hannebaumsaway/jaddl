	Join me on a quick trip down memory lane.<br/>
	<br/>
	Back in 2008, the JADDL was entering its second year after the Ragin&rsquo; Black Squirrels Association re-branding. That season, a new feature would be introduced to the league that would become a fixture from then on.<br/>
	<br/>
	The newsletter.<br/>
	<br/>
	The first article ever written highlighted the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks&rsquo; win over Team Odouls, powered by DeAngelo Williams. Sound familiar? That same story would bookend the 2008 season with an encore in Jared Bowl II.<br/>
	<br/>
	We&rsquo;re deviating from the point, thought. The point is, the precedent had been set that articles&mdash;and their accompanying PhotoShops&mdash;would showcase a team each and every week.<br/>
	<br/>
	In the beginning, for some inexplicable reason, the newsletter was shared with the league in image form&hellip;yes, image form&hellip;via email. The next year, Dropbox was adopted as the sharing mechanism of choice, and PDFs were the medium.<br/>
	<br/>
	In 2010, the newsletter made its most drastic metamorphosis to date: it became an entire website. The predecessor to the one you&rsquo;re on right this minute. No more passing of files from point to point; content published to the web for instant viewing pleasure. Amazing! Of course, the site looked pretty shitty, but one has to start somewhere.<br/>
	<br/>
	Over the following two years, the website grew, as you know. Content beyond the articles were added, changed, removed, added again, and expanded upon. At some point the articles lost the attention they were given in the beginning; not quite an afterthought, but heading that way.<br/>
	<br/>
	Not anymore.<br/>
	<br/>
	With the 2013 release of jaddl.com, articles have been given the love and respect they deserve. Here&rsquo;s a quick rundown of the features you can now enjoy as you read the living history of our beloved league:<br/>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Arrow key navigation.</b> When you&rsquo;re in the News section of the site (such as right now), you can get to the previous and next articles by simply clicking the left or right arrow keys on your keyboard, respectively. How&rsquo;s that for convenience?</li><br/>
		<li><b>Instant comments.</b> This feature was touched on in the <a target="_blank" href="http://youtu.be/ULArZO14DI4?hd=1">domain launch video</a>. Now, when you post a comment, the page doesn&rsquo;t go through the tedious task of reloading; your comment simply appears among the others immediately. <i>Magic.</i></li><br/>
		<li><b>Universal page navigation.</b> See the little arrow(s) at the top of the page, next to &ldquo;2013 sneak peek p3&rdquo;? Click them (when you&rsquo;re done reading this article). Click them to your heart&rsquo;s content. They&rsquo;ll take you to previous and next articles as long as there <i>are</i> previous and next articles. Not just for this current week&hellip;for the entirety of the article catalog.</li><br/>
