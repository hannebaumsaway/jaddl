	As your commissioner, I want to apologize. For a league as prestigious and proud as this one, an unacceptable situation has existed the past six years&mdash;a situation which was completely rectifiable.<br/>

	We haven&rsquo;t had a real championship trophy.<br/>
	<br/>
	Well, I&rsquo;m happy to tell you that this travesty has been resolved. Thanks to a couple nice fellows on eBay and the fine folks at Midwest Trophy & Engraving, we now have a true Court-Ordered Limousine worthy of its standing as our league&rsquo;s championship hardware.<br/>
	<br/>
	If you want to know what the trophy is like in person, you&rsquo;ll have to ask Ian, as it now rests in its (current) rightful place at his abode. Or, you&rsquo;ll just have to go out and win the damn thing for yourself in December.<br/>

	<br/>
	Fight hard out there, boys&hellip;you&rsquo;re <i>actually</i> playing for something other than money from now on.
