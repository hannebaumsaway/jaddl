<br/>	
<br/>	As Peyton Manning goes, so goes Team Odouls.
<br/>	
<br/>	In Odouls&rsquo; four losses so far this season, Manning averaged 19.8 points per game, never scoring above 25 in any of the contests. In their six wins, Manning put up 27.9 points per game, without ever scoring <em>below</em> 25.
<br/>	
<br/>	That&rsquo;s an 8.1 PPG difference between Manning in Odouls&rsquo; wins and losses, for those of you keeping track at home. And that&rsquo;s a very clear baseline with which to evaluate Odouls&rsquo; season.
<br/>	
<br/>	This past weekend, Odouls got Good Peyton&mdash;and, subsequently, the win&mdash;in a 98.0&ndash;92.1 effort against the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks.
<br/>	
<br/>	The victory was a crucial one as the playoff dominoes begin to fall. Odouls climbed up to 6-4 (5-2) and all the way up to second in the East, while the Shanks stumbled back below .500 to 4-6 (1-6) and down to fifth.
<br/>	
<br/>	Because the Bensons knocked off The Mighty Boom, there now exists a giant clusterfuck at 6-4 in the Beastly East, with the faltering Falcons struggling to stay above the heap.
<br/>	
<br/>	So Odouls, once 1-2, now finds itself in prime postseason position.
<br/>	
<br/>	&ldquo;It&rsquo;s high time we brought home another set of Surrendered Keys, the greatest trophy in the land,&rdquo; Adam declared following the game.
<br/>	
<br/>	<em>Don&rsquo;t you mean the Court-Ordered Limousine?</em> asked a reporter.
<br/>	
<br/>	&ldquo;The what?&rdquo; Adam replied.
<br/>	
<br/>	Before visions of another runner-up finish go dancing through Adam&rsquo;s head, he has to finish strong in a stretch that features the Bensons and Boom. With the Falcons free-falling back to the pack, an Eastern title isn&rsquo;t at all out of the realm of possibility for Odouls.
<br/>	
<br/>	Hand the Bensons a loss this weekend to start, and a playoff spot is all but assured.
