	League champions in 2003. Playoff participants in 2006 and 2007. Also-rans in 2008?<br><br>	Not so fast, say the One Pump Chumps.<br><br>	With two weeks to go in the regular season, the Chumps sit in 9th place at 4-7. While the wax is waning and the light is certainly dim, the candle of hope isn&rsquo;t completely snuffed out just yet. If the Chumps manage to win their final two games, the playoffs are still within the Chumps&rsquo; reach.<br><br>	It&rsquo;s a long reach, though, and one that would require outside assistance. Lawrence Football Jesus and the Red Hornets would have to lose both of their remaining games, and The &rsquo;Ta Tweeners would either have to drop one of their remaining games as well, or get outscored by the Chumps by at least 5.5 points.<br><br>	It&rsquo;s a long shot, but hey, at least they have something to play for, right?<br><br>	&ldquo;Remember my 2003 squad?&rdquo; asked Chumps owner Jesse. &ldquo;Awesome.&rdquo;<br><br>	But what about this year&rsquo;s Chumps and their playoff chances?<br><br>	&ldquo;Yeah, we&rsquo;re focused on the goal and all that shit, bla bla bla. But that 2003 championship team&mdash;they were a bunch of ballers, man!&rdquo;<br><br>	Chumps fans can only hope their team is more focused than its owner. They seemed to be this past weekend, as they demolished The Fifth Reich by 52 points, 100.8&ndash;48.8. Seeing as how they have the league&rsquo;s bottom-feeders, Mr. Mclovin and The Flying Pigs, in their final two games, the Chumps may be able to take care of their part of the equation. But if the pieces outside their control don&rsquo;t fall into place, Jesse may be left reminiscing about his 2003 team for several months more.<br><br>	Happy memories&hellip;he&rsquo;s got that going for him, at least. Which is nice.
