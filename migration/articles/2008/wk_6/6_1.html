	&ldquo;Come get some.&rdquo;<br><br>	That&rsquo;s the message the Red Hornets are spreading to the league. &ldquo;Remember us?&rdquo; is another one. With The Mighty Boom continuing to march through its schedule unscathed, the picture is beginning to look eerily familiar. It was Team Odouls who poked the Hornets&rsquo; nest while undefeated a year ago, and the Hornets made Odouls its bitch&mdash;twice&mdash;en route to the JADDL crown.<br><br>	Will history repeat? It&rsquo;s certainly looking like the Hornets are worthy of challenging for the title yet again, as they buzzed to an easy 84.3&ndash;47.2 victory over The Fifth Reich this past weekend, moving them to third place in the league at 4-2.<br><br>	It&rsquo;s hard to say why people consistently overlook the Hornets. Some say it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re located clear the hell out in McCainland, also known as Arizona. Others think it&rsquo;s due to their owner, Daniel, being a damn southpaw daywalker, and so hard to take seriously. Whatever the reason: it&rsquo;s a bad idea.<br><br>	&ldquo;I enjoy playing the underdog role,&rdquo; said Dan. &ldquo;Opponents never took me and my &lsquo;skyball&rsquo; seriously when we played Caps back in the day, either, and&hellip;well, I lost a lot of Caps games, so forget that comparison.&rdquo;<br><br>	The next few weeks will tell a lot about what kind of team the Hornets truly have, as they have to plow through the gauntlet of the Leavenworth Law Dogs, The Mighty Boom, and the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks, the fourth-, first-, and fifth-place teams, respectively.<br><br>	The Fifth Reich, on the other hand, is losing traction on its &ldquo;scary underdog&rdquo; role, losers of two straight after blitzing to an improbable .500 record. They&rsquo;re starting to look more like the Reich we all laughed at during the draft.<br><br>	&ldquo;M&mdash;ssen wir diese Schei&mdash;e drehte sich um,&rdquo; said Reich owner John.
