	Can you feel the Mclovin tonight? As we enter the middle portion of the season, and the teams begin to separate, each game becomes increasingly more important for the bottom half of the league.<br><br>	That&rsquo;s why this weekend&rsquo;s 101.7&ndash;64.9 victory for Mr. Mclovin over fellow bottom-halfer The &rsquo;Ta Tweeners was such a massive one.<br><br>	&ldquo;We were distracted by their uniforms,&rdquo; confessed Tweeners owner Nolan. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re friggin&rsquo; beautiful man.&rdquo;<br><br>	That may be the case, but this was a crushing blow to the Tweeners&rsquo; playoff hopes, kicking them to 1-4 and gasping for air. The most disappointing part about such an important swing game is that the Tweeners were never in the discussion. They got just 19.3 points from their QB and RBs combined, whereas Mclovin got 26.5 points from Brandon Jacobs alone. You don&rsquo;t need to look much further for a reason why the Tweeners got blown out.<br><br>	At 2-3, Mclovin has managed to stay relevant in the playoff hunt for the immediate future. They sit in 7th place, just outside the magic 6 spot needed to chase the Beer Goblet.<br><br>	Though Mclovin&rsquo;s owner Lannie could not be reached because he&rsquo;s currently serving a jail sentence for an incident in Manhattan in early September, his lawyer stated that he is &ldquo;happy about the win, and optimistic about the rest of the season.&rdquo;<br><br>	On a related note, word is that Lannie&rsquo;s fantasy prison-league team is doing quite well also, being led by former Bad Newz Kennels quarterback Michael Vick.
