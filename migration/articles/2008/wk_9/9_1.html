	Yes, this was only their second win, and yes, The Flying Pigs are well out of playoff contention.<br><br>	But that didn&rsquo;t stop them from playing a part in shaping the playoff picture this past weekend. In a game that left the playoff participants and seeding even more in question than they already were, the Pigs handed the Leavenworth Law Dogs their third loss of the season in a nail-biter, 91.4&ndash;90.9.<br><br>	The game came down to the final minutes of Monday night. Pigs RB Frank Gore provided the dagger that neutered the Dogs as he scampered for a mere 3 yards with 6:53 left to go in the game. Those 3 yards put the Pigs ahead of the Dogs by 0.2 points. Gore finished his game-winning day with 10.5 points.<br><br>	&ldquo;Going into the day, I knew what I needed to do for us to win,&rdquo; said Gore. &ldquo;I could&rsquo;ve won a few other games for us, but since Ryan has money riding on&mdash;I just gave 110% tonight.&rdquo;<br><br>	Say what? The Pigs have lost 3 games this season by less than 10 points. In those 3 losses, Gore averaged 13.9 points&mdash;a respectable mark. Fellow RB Ryan Grant, however, averaged just 6.9 points in those losing efforts. When asked about the accusation and whether it&rsquo;s caused trouble in the locker room, Pigs owner Jacob simply shook his head.<br><br>	&ldquo;Hey, at least someone on this team is having fun this year,&rdquo; scoffed Jacob. &ldquo;What last-place team doesn&rsquo;t have trouble in the locker room? I hate most of these guys personally.&rdquo;<br><br>	The game, though hardly cheering up Pigs fans (all 17 of them), may have huge implications for the league. It dropped the Law Dogs to 7-3, a much more vulnerable spot seeding-wise than 8-2 would have been. Team Hauloll and the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks, both victors this past weekend, are close enough to sniff the Dogs&rsquo; butt.
