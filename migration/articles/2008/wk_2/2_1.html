	It&rsquo;s still early in the season, but the cream of the crop is already beginning to thin. In a matchup between two unbeatens, the Leavenworth Law Dogs crucified Lawrence Football Jesus by a final of 105.8&ndash;73.2.<br><br>	The Law Dogs got solid production from most positions, with halfback Brian Westbrook leading the charge. Westbrook racked up 28.3 points thanks to 3 touchdowns&mdash;2 rushing, 1 receiving.<br><br>	At the postgame presser, Westbrook started barking loudly at the media, urinated on the microphone, and started attacking sideline report Erin Andrews. When asked to comment on the incident, Law Dogs owner Alex just smiled and whispered, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my boy.&rdquo;<br><br>	Neither team got good performances from its quarterback. Law Dogs signal caller Drew Brees netted 9.5 points in a mediocre-at-best outing, while Jesus&rsquo; laughable excuse for a starter, Jake Delhomme, put up 3.3&mdash;almost 2 full points shy of kicker Jeff Reed&rsquo;s production on the day.<br><br>	&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why James has me out here,&rdquo; said Delhomme, referring to Jesus&rsquo; owner. &ldquo;I told him I just wanted to lounge by the water cooler this season and collect my checks.&rdquo;<br><br>	Various Jesus personnel have stated that Delhomme may be romantically involved with one of the waterboys, a 17-year-old named Randy.<br><br>	On an unrelated note (maybe), James has hinted that a trade may be in the works for Football Jesus as soon as this week. Though we won&rsquo;t know the teams and players involved until the trade actually goes through&mdash;if it does&mdash;JADDL analysts are guessing that it&rsquo;ll include a QB. No one would be happier about that, it seems, than Jake Delhomme.<br><br>	Except Randy, that is.
