	Like one of those State Farm commercials would ponder, &ldquo;You know that place between home and the playoffs?&rdquo; Well, The &rsquo;Ta Tweeners are no longer there. After winning two in a row at the midway point in the season, the Tweeners have dropped three of their last four to fall to 4-8, ninth place in the league, and&mdash;most important&mdash;officially out of playoff contention.<br><br>	As to whether they were ever really in contention&hellip;you know that place between perception and reality? The Tweeners were so there. A closer look at their schedule exposes a lot of smoke &rsquo;tween mirrors with the Tweeners&rsquo; record. Three of their four wins came against teams in the bottom half of the league&mdash;two of those against the bottom-feeders, The Flying Pigs and The Fifth Reich. Against the top half of the league, the Tweeners are just 1-5.<br><br>	&ldquo;We were able to kid ourselves for a bit there,&rdquo; admitted Tweeners owner Nolan. &ldquo;But this in-between crap is getting old. We&rsquo;re always on the cusp, but never able to break the seal.&rdquo;<br><br>	As a reference to just what the hell Nolan was talking about, his team (then Nomac&rsquo;s Nomads) finished 7-5-1 a year ago, in seventh place and just a spot outside the playoffs. He was that poor sap who&rsquo;s at the front of the line when the movie sells out. With a win over Team Hauloll this weekend, Nomac might be that poor sap in the dreaded 7-spot yet again. It&rsquo;s doubtful Hauloll&mdash;also known as the Fighting Thigpens&mdash;will overlook the Tweeners, however, as they&rsquo;re battling for seeding with the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks. The &rsquo;Shanks, coincidentally, are the ones who unceremoniously dumped the &rsquo;Tweeners from the playoff discussion this past weekend with a 93.3&ndash;65.7 beating.<br><br>	So how will Nomac be spending his time during the playoffs this year?<br><br>	&ldquo;Probably doing the laundry, or dishes or some shit.&rdquo;
