	And then there were none. That&rsquo;s how many undefeated teams remain near the halfway point of the 2008 JADDL season. And ironically, the team that made it clear to the final week of the regular season undefeated a year ago is the same team that made sure that didn&rsquo;t happen again, as Team Odouls took down The Mighty Boom, 115.3&ndash;104.4.<br><br>	Odouls owner Adam (no, not &ldquo;Pacman&rdquo;) downplayed the significance of handing Boom its first loss, instead focusing on the aftermath of the game as it relates to the league standings.<br><br>	&ldquo;We&rsquo;re back where we belong, at the top of the JADDL,&rdquo; said Adam. &ldquo;This time, we&rsquo;re not going to let that little bitch from Arizona sneak up on us and kill our season, either.&rdquo;<br><br>	That &ldquo;little bitch&rdquo; he&rsquo;s referring to, of course, is Red Hornets owner Daniel, a.k.a. &ldquo;Dan.&rdquo; The Hornets turned Odouls&rsquo; dream season into a nightmare in 2007, ending Odouls&rsquo; undefeated and championship hopes in two fell swoops. Team Odouls has already beaten the Hornets this season.<br><br>	Mighty Boom owner Peter, a.k.a. &ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; could not stick around for his scheduled post-game conference, as he had to fly to a &ldquo;Fire Ron Prince&rdquo; rally in Manhattan, KS, where he signed up to sell &ldquo;Hire Gary Patterson&rdquo; t-shirts. However, he did take the time to text the following message to reporters from his sweet Sprint phone:<br><br>	&ldquo;wtf, game sucked, b back l8r.&rdquo;<br><br>	We know you&rsquo;ll be back, Peter&hellip;we know you will.
