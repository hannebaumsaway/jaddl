	Could we have another chase for perfection on our hands this year? It&rsquo;s early yet, but after three weeks it looks like The Mighty Boom (3-0) has all the potential in the world to make a run at it.<br><br>	So far, no one has even challenged Boom, which has won its first three games by an average margin of 29.6 points, scoring at a 104.9 points per game clip, best in the JADDL. This scoring onslaught is being led by some guy named Matt Forte, who is apparently a rookie out of Tulane. Yes: Tulane. Forte had another solid outing this week, scoring 21.5 points against noted pacifists Lawrence Football Jesus (1-2) in a 99.1 &mdash; 71.7 Boom victory.<br><br>	After the game, Boom owner Peter didn&rsquo;t act elated or surprised about his team&rsquo;s 3-0 start.<br><br>	&ldquo;Eagle Scout, friends, Eagle Scout,&rdquo; said Peter, pounding his chest at the podium. &ldquo;Always be prepared&hellip;to kick Jesus&rsquo; ass, that is. Now let&rsquo;s go eat some sandwiches!&rdquo;<br><br>	Speaking of Jesus, for such a famous figurehead, his team sure can&rsquo;t seem to handle the spotlight. After busting out of the gate with a 74-point condemning of The Fifth Reich, Jesus has twice been in the Spotlight Game of the Week, and both times has tripped over its sandals in lopsided losses.<br><br>	Aspiring lawyer though he may be, Jesus owner James can&rsquo;t argue his way out of his squad&rsquo;s 1-2 start.<br><br>	&ldquo;Frustrated,&rdquo; said James, when asked about the mood in his locker room. &ldquo;Frustrated. Frrrrustrated. Frrrrrrrrrrrustrated.&rdquo;<br><br>	Frustrating, perhaps, but not really surprising; this is Old Testament stuff for Jesus, which went 11 whole weeks in 2007 before picking up its first win en route to a 1-9-3 record.<br><br>	But it&rsquo;s a new year. Maybe this time, after the third game Jesus will rise again and ascend into mediocrity.
