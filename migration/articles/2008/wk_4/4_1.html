	Sieg! Sieg! Sieg! Victory! Victory! Victory!<br><br>	Out of the game for two years. Mocked constantly during the draft. Ass-raped in the first two games of the season by an average of 56.9 points a game. And now: right in the thick of the league battle at 2-2.<br><br>	Who&rsquo;s heiling now?<br><br>	After taking down the Leavenworth Law Dogs 71.9-60 last week, The Fifth Reich made it two straight this week with a tight 84.5&ndash;81.4 victory over The Flying Pigs. Looks like there&rsquo;s not going to be any surrender or bunker-bound suicide from this squad. The Reich is getting contributions from various sources each week, making them an increasingly difficult team to scout.<br><br>	This week, The Reich&rsquo;s standard bearer was WR Laveranues Coles, who hauled in 8 catches for 105 yards and 3 TDs, good for 28.5 points. That, combined with 14 points from another unlikely source, kicker Josh Scobee, was enough to overcome lackluster efforts from The Reich&rsquo;s QB and RBs, who combined for just 22.7 points.<br><br>	&ldquo;Wir haben den Sieg wir brauchten. Die Achse wird sich wieder!&rdquo; spat Reich owner John.<br><br>	Though they wouldn&rsquo;t be in the playoffs if the season ended today, The Reich is only one spot away. The next few weeks will tell whether or not they can complete their unlikely blitzkrieg on the JADDL.
