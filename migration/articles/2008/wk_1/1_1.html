	Adam may have to drop the non-alcoholic beer and hit the hard liquor after this past weekend. <br><br>	His Team Odouls made it all the way to the final game of the regular season last year before finally losing, but it didn&rsquo;t take quite so long this time around. A strong opening performance by diabetic dandy Jay Cutler wasn&rsquo;t enough to overcome weak outings by the rest of the Odouls 9-pack, and the reigning JADDL regular season champs fell&mdash;and fell hard&mdash;to the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks, 111.1-67. <br><br>	The Longshanks no doubt consider this sweet revenge for the 84&ndash;55 drubbing Odouls handed them in Houston a year ago, which was only their 2nd loss of the season at the time.<br><br>	&ldquo;Hell yes I consider this sweet revenge,&rdquo; said &rsquo;Shanks owner Ryan. &ldquo;You know what isn&rsquo;t sweet? Non-alcoholic beer. That&rsquo;s like licking the bottom of a pizza and throwing it away. Bullshit.&rdquo;<br><br>	There was nothing bullshit about the performance of Longshanks RB Michael Turner, who gashed the bottom of Odouls&rsquo; can, pulled the tab, and shotgunned his way to 36.5 points on 220 yards and 2 TDs.
