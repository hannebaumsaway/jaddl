	The 2008 JADDL season is on the downward side of the hill, and Team Hauloll is headed in the right direction.<br><br>	After finding itself on shaky ground a few weeks ago at 2-4, Hauloll has rattled off two straight wins to even out at .500 with five weeks left in the regular season. This week&rsquo;s 101.8&ndash;72.4 victory over fellow 4-4 team Lawrence Football Jesus came in no small part to the 23-point outing of Hauloll QB Matt Schaub, who was apparently pissed off about last week&rsquo;s JADDL Newsletter.<br><br>	&ldquo;I saw what you guys wrote about me, about how Mr. Jason might be taking a look at Quinn Gray,&rdquo; sobbed Schaub through tears in the locker room after the game. &ldquo;I think you guys are just bullies out to pick on the struggling guys. Well guess what, meanies: I&rsquo;m averaging 21 points a game since taking over as starter! Asses.&rdquo;<br><br>	Schaub then proceeded to stick his tongue out at the gathered media and storm away from the podium. But whatever his maturity level may be, it is undeniable that Schaub has given this Hauloll team a much-needed boost.<br><br>	In the other locker room, a mystery unfolded. Football Jesus started a running back in the game named Le&rsquo;Ron McClain, whom nobody has ever heard of. However, it turns out McClain is averaging 8.7 points per game, despite putting up -2 three weeks ago, a feat almost unheard of among running backs.<br><br>	&ldquo;Adrian Peterson was on a bye week,&rdquo; explained Jesus owner James. &ldquo;It was between Le&rsquo;Ron and Fred Jackson.&rdquo;<br><br>	&hellip;Fred Jackson?<br><br>	The mystery behind Jesus&rsquo; locker room door continues.
