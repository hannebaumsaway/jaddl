	MINNEAPOLIS, MN -- A year ago, the Red Hornets drew the #1 pick in the 2007 JADDL Draft. 16 weeks later, they hoisted the coveted Beer Goblet as champions of the Jared Allen's DDs League.<br/><br/>In a few short days, the Hornets will try to turn that title run into a title streak as they embark on their 2008 slate. It won't be an easy start, as they open at the Leavenworth Law Dogs, who finished 9-4 and in 3rd place (as the Bad Newz Kennels) in '07.<br/><br/>The Hornets lost LaDainian Tomlinson in the off-season, but have attempted to bridge that gap with premiere ball catcher Terrell Owens. Owens averaged 14.6 points a game last season, and could eclipse that mark with a totally healthy Ben Roethlisberger, who returns to lead the Hornets again after bringing in 16.5 ppg last year.<br/><br/>Hornets owner Daniel Romans sees no reason why his squad couldn't repeat in '08. "I've still got red hair, and I'm still left-handed. With that leprechaun magic, I can do anything!" exclaimed a jubilant Romans at the JADDL preseason press conference.<br/><br/>Time will tell if Owens and Roethlisberger&mdash;sprinkled with that luck o' the Irish from Romans&mdash;can reach the end of the rainbow a second time to snag that pot o' gold...or goblet of beer, as the case may be.
