    Thank you Darren McFadden!
<br/>	
<br/>	That is the the cry being heard in the streets of Wichita this week after McFadden and his whopping 42.9 points pulled the plug on the One Pump Chumps&rsquo; season, which had been on life support for a few weeks now.
<br/>	
<br/>	In the streets of Manhattan, they&rsquo;re just crying.
<br/>	
<br/>	After starting the season 3-0, OPC fans were ecstatic, with visions of 2003 dancing in their heads. There were warning signs, though: mainly the fact that the Chumps averaged just 77 points per game despite being undefeated in the first three weeks. Karma evened things out over the next three games, at any rate, when the Chumps went 1-2 despite an improved 87 PPG clip over that span. Another three weeks went by, and the Chumps found themselves sitting in a good spot at 6-3.
<br/>	
<br/>	It was a house of cards, however. Within that final three-week span, disaster struck: Tony Romo went down, and went down hard (that&rsquo;s what <i>she</i> said) in Week 7, putting an end to his&mdash;and OPC&rsquo;s&mdash;season. The Chumps closed out the regular season with a 1-3 slide. That one win was the one that mattered in terms of a playoff bid, but in reality, that just prolonged the misery in Manhattan for another week.
<br/>	
<br/>	The final blow was delivered by In Pursuit of Perfection, which had an impressive JADDL playoffs debut. Michael Vick has been the catalyst behind IPP&rsquo;s late surge this season (step away from the ledge, Alex!), and though Vick had a nice 24-point outing, it was McFadden who stole the show. His 42.9 points are the most scored by a single player in JADDL postseason <i>history</i>. Yep &hellip; that&rsquo;s right. Most ever in the playoffs.
<br/>	
<br/>	With that kind of a performance, a team isn&rsquo;t normally going to lose; and IPP didn&rsquo;t, moving to the semis with a 125.3 - 95.4 victory. Their reward?
<br/>	
<br/>	A date with Team Hauloll, the defending champs and 2010 points leader (by a shit ton). God speed, IPP.
