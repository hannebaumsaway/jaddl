    In the words of some random jock at the final history presentation in <i>Bill & Ted&rsquo;s Excellent Adventure</i>, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same &hellip; yet &hellip; it&rsquo;s different!&rdquo;
<br/>	
<br/>	For the third straight year, The Mighty Boom has snuggled comfortably into the JADDL semifinals. They might as well stake out a plot, apply for a loan, and start forwarding their mail here.
<br/>	
<br/>	However, the semis represented the <i>start</i> of Boom&rsquo;s postseason journey in &rsquo;08 and &rsquo;09 after earning Round 1 byes. This season required putting in work in the quarterfinals to get to this week, and Boom responded. It wasn&rsquo;t pretty or awe-inspiring, but style points are unnecessary in December, and an ugly 88.8 - 80.1 victory over the Millennium Falcons keeps Pete alive just as well as a flawless blowout would have.
<br/>	
<br/>	The ugly side to Boom&rsquo;s JADDL playoff experience is that the semis haven&rsquo;t just been the starting point &hellip; they&rsquo;ve been the ending point as well. Boom hasn&rsquo;t been to the championship game since &rsquo;06, when Pete took home the final Ragin&rsquo; Black Squirrels League title. In the 2008 semifinals, Boom got crushed by the red-hot eventual champion Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks. In &rsquo;09, the role of spoiler was once again played by the eventual champ, Team Hauloll.
<br/>	
<br/>	No one around the league would be shocked if this sad tale repeated itself yet again in 2010. The Boomers stumbled into the postseason to begin with, following a 5-0 start with a 3-5 finish. During that first stretch, they averaged 105 points per game; during the latter stretch, that average fell way down to 84. That falls in line with the 89 they put up this past weekend, and that may not be enough to knock off The Bad News Bensons, who put up 98 PPG the final four weeks of the regular season.
<br/>	
<br/>	The Bensons also won&rsquo;t be daunted by Boom&rsquo;s semifinal experience. It just so happens that Alex&rsquo;s franchise is the only one aside from The Mighty Boom that will have tallied three JADDL semifinal appearances after this coming weekend&rsquo;s games. However, like Boom, the Bensons&rsquo; last two trips have ended in tears &hellip; of despair, not joy.
<br/>	
<br/>	Something&rsquo;s gotta give, and one of these teams will exorcise their semifinal demons this weekend. Will the Bensons make their first-ever championship game appearance, or will The Boom cash in on all the promise they showed at the start of the season?
