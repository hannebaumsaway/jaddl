    As they say, hindsight is twenty-twenty. In Pursuit of Perfection was the feature team in the Week 3 newsletter, and boy, are there some retrospective gems in that sucker &hellip<br/>
	<br/>
	<i>Success of any kind is a rarity [to Nolan&rsquo;s franchise] &hellip;<br/>
	<br/>
	&hellip; Nomac is nothing if not consistent&hellip;ly bad &hellip;<br/>
	<br/>
	&hellip; perhaps the good people of Ta-Town should put the parade on hold &hellip;</i><br/>
	<br/>
	Well, Wichitans, you can officially resume parade preparations. Your Perfectionists are champs of the JADDL after taking out The Bad News Bensons in Jared Bowl IV, 99.3 - 90.3.<br/>
	<br/>
	There&rsquo;s another nugget from that Week 3 newsletter that is less foot-in-mouth and more Nostradamus: <i>&hellip; maybe Dwayne Bowe will start putting up decent numbers once Matt Cassel figures out how to be more like Tom Brady and less like Elvis Grbac.</i> Well, lo and behold, Cassel had a Pro Bowl-caliber year, and the primary benefactor from that development was Dwayne Bowe. Bowe, and In Pursuit of Perfection. When the dust settled on the regular season, Bowe wasn&rsquo;t just decent; he was the top receiver in the JADDL.<br/>
	<br/>
	Bowe&rsquo;s emergence moved IPP from playoff contender to title contender. With Michael Vick, Chris Johnson, and Darren McFadden in place, the Perfectionists were poised to make a run.<br/>
	<br/>
	And make a run they did.<br/>
	<br/>
	IPP closed out the regular season with a 3-1 sprint, averaging 115 points over that four-game stretch. When the playoffs arrived, they didn&rsquo;t let up &hellip; in fact, they stepped it up a notch, averaging 127 points in the first two rounds, both lopsided victories over West Division rivals One Pump Chumps and Team Hauloll.<br/>
	<br/>
	Then it was on to the Jared Bowl to take on the East Division Champion Bensons for the right to take home the Court-Ordered Limousine trophy. The Bensons were coming off a bye and a convincing victory over The Mighty Boom, so the matchup promised to be a good one.<br/>
	<br/>
	It did not disappoint.<br/>
	<br/>
	However, instead of the high scoring affair most expected, both teams were held under 100 points for the first time in their respective playoff runs. For the Bensons, Drew Brees had a mundane performance and Michael Turner was a no-show. For IPP, Vick had a somewhat tempered outing by his lofty standards, and Johnson and McFadden failed to pick up the slack.<br/>
	<br/>
	But fantasy football is a team imaginary game, and IPP got help from the unlikeliest of sources when it needed it most &hellip;<br/>
	<br/>
	LeGarrette Blount.<br/>
	<br/>
	You may remember Blount from his (limited) days with the Oregon Ducks, punctuated&mdash;and cut short&mdash;by his <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_3299v-A1o&feature=related">unusual post-game meeting with a Boise State player</a> in 2009. Well, his latest foray into national news is a more positive one; his 16.7 points put IPP on top of the fantasy football world.<br/>
	<br/>
	This was Pursuit&rsquo;s first jaunt into the JADDL playoffs, and they made it count. The Bensons treat the playoffs like an annual holiday retreat, but once again they go home empty-handed.<br/>
	<br/>
	In a year that kicked off a new decade, the JADDL has a new franchise to add to its list of champions.<br/>
	<br/>
	Savor it, Nolan.
