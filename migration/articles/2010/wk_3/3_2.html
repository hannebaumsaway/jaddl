    On Capitol Hill, it&rsquo;s common for a resolution to get shot down numerous times before finally being adopted several years after initially being brought to the floor.<br/>
	<br/>
	If that tradition applies to fantasy football as well, we may be looking at the repeal of waiver deadlines in 2013, give or take a year.<br/>
	<br/>
	The point, however, is that you won&rsquo;t be seeing them in 2010. The proposal to end the waiver deadline system and replace it with a first-come-first-served approach was sent to league officials from The Bad News Bensons front office in Overland Park. League owners cast their votes on Wednesday morning, and the proposal was dead in the fantasy water before lunch.<br/>
	<br/>
	The suggestion was immediately met with resolute and venomous opposition from the Millennium Falcons&rsquo; and Football Jesus&rsquo; ownership in particular.<br/>
	<br/>
	&ldquo;REJECT! Boooooooooooo,&rdquo; spat Ian from his office in Lawrence. &ldquo;You think you&rsquo;re the new Trent Dilfer or something, with all this superior football knowledge? With bye weeks coming up everyone will be waiver wiring, and I&rsquo;m sure that those of us that can&rsquo;t read Rick Reilly at work would appreciate a fair system.&rdquo;<br/>
	<br/>
	James&rsquo; response was even more pointed: &ldquo;Alex&rsquo;s proposal is the most bone-fucking-retarded thing I&rsquo;ve ever heard.&rdquo;<br/>
	<br/>
	The proposal wasn&rsquo;t quite unanimously rejected, however. The IPA Connoisseur&rsquo;s front office sent in an &ldquo;Approve&rdquo; vote without commentary. The lack of commentary was likely out of fear&hellip;fear from being lambasted by James, as Alex was.<br/>
	<br/>
	From the desk of In Pursuit of Perfection&rsquo;s owner came a counter-proposal of sorts, involving a monetary bidding system for free agents, without ever actually rejecting or approving Alex&rsquo;s original idea. This counter-proposal was completely ignored by the other league owners at the time this article was published.<br/>
	<br/>
	Jason replied with a Reject vote, yet followed that up with facetious comments about President Obama and communism, which confused the league into thinking the Hauloll front office actually supported the proposal. Nevertheless, Hauloll&rsquo;s official vote was put down as Reject.<br/>
	<br/>
	In light of the swift negative response to the idea, Alex conceded defeat at 11:22 AM CDT. For now, the waiver deadline remains in place, and those owners in the league whose day jobs don&rsquo;t allow them countless hours on the Internet still have a fighting chance.
