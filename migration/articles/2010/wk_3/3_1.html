	The playoffs are a foreign thing to Nolan and his franchise. Success of any kind is a rarity. In fact, victories are such a scarce commodity for him, starting the season out 2-1 with a Briefly Badass award already tucked away in his giant cowboy hat is cause for celebration in the streets of Wichita.<br/>
	<br/>
	But wait&hellip;<br/>
	<br/>
	Nolan&rsquo;s best finish since the JADDL&rsquo;s inception is 7th place, in the league&rsquo;s first year (2007). Since then, he&rsquo;s logged two consecutive 10th-place finishes. Nomac is nothing if not consistent&hellip;ly bad. However&mdash;and this is potentially bad news for him&mdash;he&rsquo;s actually started out like this in two of the past three seasons: 2-1-1 in 2007 and 2-1 in 2009. So perhaps the good people of Ta-Town should put the parade on hold for the time being. For the record, Nolan&rsquo;s franchise (then called NoMac&rsquo;s Nomads) did actually compile a winning record in that magically mediocre &rsquo;07 season (7-5-1).<br/>
	<br/>
	This year&rsquo;s strong start has been powered by the most unlikely of catalysts: Michael &ldquo;Kibbles And&rdquo; Vick. (Side note: that would&rsquo;ve made a great team name, Alex.) Speaking of Alex, how pissed is he now that Vick has put up 21, 25, and 37 points in the first three games? That outpaces The Bad News Bensons&rsquo; Drew Brees by 9 points per game. Boom! Roasted.<br/>
	<br/>
	IPP also employs the services of Chris Johnson, who has been perfectly Chris Johnson-like thus far, which doesn&rsquo;t hurt. Something else that doesn&rsquo;t hurt is the unexpected 18.2 PPG contribution from Darren McFadden.<br/>
	<br/>
	A potential gotcha for Nolan is his receiver corps. Brandon Marshall looks like he could come on strong, but Calvin Johnson will always be limited by the fact that he plays for Dying-More-Each-Day Detroit. But who knows: maybe Dwayne Bowe will start putting up decent numbers once Matt Cassel figures out how to be more like Tom Brady and less like Elvis Grbac. The Chiefs&rsquo; running game isn&rsquo;t going to do In Pursuit any favors, though.<br/>
	<br/>
	By the way, IPP&rsquo;s latest conquest was a 146<sub>4</sub> - 106<sub>9</sub> dismantling of the defending champs, Team Hauloll. This marks the second consecutive week in which a team has put up over 100 points and still lost by 35+. In short, there are some dominating numbers being put up early&hellip;by unlikely candidates, no less.<br/>
	<br/>
	So, does Nolan have his eyes cautiously gazing toward the playoffs finally?<br/>
	<br/>
	&ldquo;Playoffs? Don&rsquo;t talk about playoffs! <i>Playoffs?</i> You want to talk to me about playoffs? Psh&hellip;.<i>Playoffs?!</i> Are you <i>kiddin&rsquo;</i> me? I just hope we can win our next game.&rdquo;<br/>

	Jim Mora in the house!
