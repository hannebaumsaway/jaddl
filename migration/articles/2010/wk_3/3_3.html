		For the third time in four years, the team with the last draft pick enters Week 4 undefeated. <b>The Mighty Boom</b> beat <b>Team Odouls</b> to move to 3-0 and in sole possession of first place in the East. Not that it means anything. Last year, <b>IPA</b> was 3-0 heading into week 4 too, but finished up a disappointing 6th, going 6-7. In 2007, <b>NoMac&rsquo;s Nomads</b> was 2-0-1 after getting the last pick, but again finished 7th at 7-5-1. Teams with the last pick are 8-3-1 in the first three weeks over the last four years. In comparison, teams with the first pick are only 6-5-1 through three weeks since 2007.
<br/>
<br/>
		The <b>Millenium Falcons</b> are 2-1 and the highest scoring team in the league after another thrashing (113.6-60.2 against <b>Football Jesus</b>), but still can&rsquo;t spell their name correctly.

		<u>Clutch Performances:</u> <b>Santana Moss</b> grabbed 16.4 points in a close game for the <b>Red Hornets</b>, keeping them from remaining winless against winless IPA. <b>The Bad New Bensons</b> (2-1) needed all of <b>Jamal Charles&rsquo;</b> 15.4 points, as their manager decided to play without a defense and had five players with less than 6 points.

		<u>Bench Player of the Week:</u> Seven players that weren&rsquo;t playing had 20+ points, but nothing has to hurt as much as <b>Anquan Boldin&rsquo;s</b> 32.2 points in in the <b>Flying Pigs</b> ten-point loss to the <b>One Pump Chumps</b>.
	</div><br/>
		Speaking of the Chumps, don&rsquo;t make too much of their perfect 3-0 record. They&rsquo;ve only had 189.9 points scored on them (63.3/game). Even the Pigs score more points than that. They can&rsquo;t score either: Every team in the East has put up more on the scoreboard than the Chumps.

		<u>Games to Watch:</u> Both division&rsquo;s top teams will face off in week 4. Next week the two highest scoring teams face off to see who&rsquo;s tops in the East. Don&rsquo;t look for an upset though, as the red-hot Falcons will be without their top scorer <b>Adrian Peterson</b> (bye week), and the Boom is 27-4 in the last three years. The top two teams in the West will be facing off too, but look for <b>Team Hauloll</b> to rebound after losing to the <b>LLC</b>, and grab the top spot with <b>Jeremy Maclin</b> (22.3 points in week 3) filling in for <b>Dez Bryant</b>, off with a bye.
