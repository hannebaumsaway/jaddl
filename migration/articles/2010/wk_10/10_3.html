		<li>The Newsletter Curse strikes yet again! The latest victim: Jesse and his One Pump Chumps, falling to Lannie the Connoisseur.</li><br/>
		<li>More compelling evidence that the Curse is real: the Connoisseur has just three wins on the year; two of them came against foes who were coming off Newsletter features (IPP in Week 4, OPC this week).</li><br/>
		<li>&hellip; Sooooo, how will that work in Week 11 with the Connoisseur itself being featured this week?</li><br/>
		<li>Division War update: the West has followed up its collective head-to-head triumph by taking the lead in overall points, 5370.4 to 5224.3.</li><br/>
		<li>The JADDL standings have been a bit of a rollercoaster recently; the longest current streak for any team is three (Hauloll&rsquo;s winning streak).</li><br/>
		<li>Nolan &hellip; 155.6 points?! Good god man, well done.</li><br/>
		<li>It helps when your quarterback puts up over half a hundie. Crazy that that quarterback was Michael &ldquo;All You Haters Can Suck My&rdquo; Vick.</li><br/>
		<li>How much does that sting, Alex? It&rsquo;s like you sold your Microsoft stock a month before the release of Windows 95.</li><br/>
		<li>Is The Mighty Boom mighty no more? Since the start of interdivisional play back in Week 6, Boom has averaged just 76.2 points per game with a 2-3 record.</li><br/>
		<li>Coincidentally, Boom graced the cover of the newsletter in Week 5 &hellip; perhaps the Curse is more powerful that we possibly imagined, and extends beyond just the following week! <img alt="" src="http://goemaw.com/forum/Smileys/goEMAW/Oh%20No.gif" /></li><br/>
