    It&rsquo;s Week 10. That&rsquo;s about six weeks after The IPA Connoisseur was all but eliminated from postseason contention. But does that mean Lannie has given up on making a mark on the 2010 JADDL season?
<br/>    
<br/>    Hell no.
<br/>    
<br/>    Lannie is taking a page out of David Glass&rsquo;s book. Glass&rsquo;s Kansas City Royals have been playoff contenders beyond June just once in the past 16 years, yet they often help shape baseball&rsquo;s October landscape. How? They&rsquo;re always rising up and inexplicably beating playoff hopefuls in the waning moments of September, often shuffling the AL Central or wild card races. In that way, Glass feels his franchise contributes to the annals of MLB history, despite being a permanent resident in the <i>anal</i> cavity of the league.
<br/>    
<br/>    Clearly, the Connoisseur owner noticed that and thought, <i>Hey, what a great idea!</i>
<br/>    
<br/>    IPA (3-7) has been occupying the basement of the JADDL West since the start of the season, yet played a potentially major role in the selection of West teams for the postseason this past weekend. They strolled into Manhattan and humiliated the One Pump Chumps, 118.9 - 88.1. Though the Chumps would still be in the playoffs if the season ended today, this loss has the potential to be absolutely devastating by the time the season actually does come to a close. Rather than sitting at 7-3, a game back of division leader Team Hauloll and two games up on the fourth place (and current first-out) Red Hornets, the Chumps find themselves at 6-4, third place, and just a single game ahead of the lurking &rsquo;Nets.
<br/>    
<br/>    In other words, OPC is now in for a massive dog fight, which gives the edge to second-place In Pursuit of Perfection and their dog fighting expert QB Michael Vick.
<br/>    
<br/>    The Connoisseur was led by WR Mike Wallace&mdash;not to be confused with the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Wallace_%28journalist%29' target='_blank'><i>60 Minutes</i> correspondent</a>&mdash;with 25.6 points, followed by RB Justin Forsett with 15.5. OPC was paced by 24.3 points from Maurice Jones-Drew.
<br/>    
<br/>    &ldquo;It feels good,&rdquo; said Lannie. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to be relevant in the grand scheme of things, even for a couple weeks out of the year.&rdquo;
<br/>    
<br/>    Well, Lannie, you have a chance to be relevant throughout the remainder of the season, bro! The Connoisseur wraps up its 2010 campaign with games against all three of the Chumps&rsquo; fellow contenders: the Red Hornets, IPP, and Team Hauloll. Right now, Lannie is set to get a bag of poop from Jesse for Christmas, but if he finishes the year 3-0, or at least 2-1 with wins over the Hornets and IPP, Jesse may send him a bottle of Patr&#0243;n instead.
<br/>    
<br/>    Alright, Mr. Gla&mdash;er, Lannie&mdash;go make some noise in the playoff scene in the only way you can: disruptively.
