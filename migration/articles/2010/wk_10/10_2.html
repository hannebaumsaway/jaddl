    <i>So you&rsquo;re sayin&rsquo; there&rsquo;s a chance!</i>
<br/>	
<br/>	&hellip;Of a repeat, that is.
<br/>	
<br/>	This past weekend, Team Hauloll became the first team to earn a postseason bid in the 2010 season with an easy peasy 129.1 - 57.7 drubbing of The Flying Pigs. The victory moves Hauloll up to 8-2 overall, with a 6-1 record against JADDL West foes. Those two records guarantee Hauloll will finish in the top three of their division, since in the worst-case scenario&mdash;three straight losses to close out at 8-5&mdash;they would own the tiebreaker over the Red Hornets with a 6-4 divisional record (the best the Hornets can do is 8-5 and 5-5 divisionally).
<br/>	
<br/>	This means there are just two spots left on the West&rsquo;s side of the bracket, and four teams are still alive to claim them. The IPA Connoisseur is done-dee, but <a href="news/2010/wk_10/index.php?view=news&amp;yr=2010&amp;wk=10&amp;pg=1">Lannie hopes to influence the playoffs in a different manner</a>.
<br/>	
<br/>	In Pursuit of Perfection has the inside track of the remaining hopefuls due to their huge points advantage over the One Pump Chumps (997.3 to 806.9) and two-game divisional record lead over the Red Hornets.
<br/>	
<br/>	The Hornets themselves&mdash;despite being in fourth place at the moment&mdash;are nipping at OPC&rsquo;s ass. Though the &rsquo;Nets are two games back of OPC divisionally, that might not end up meaning anything. They&rsquo;re just a game back overall, setting up an epic season finale when the Ginger Stingers travel to Manhattan to take on the Chumps head to head in what could essentially amount to a play-in game. The Hornets won the first matchup in Scottsdale 95.4 - 83.5, and if the Hornets and OPC end up tied both overall and divisionally, chances are good the Hornets will hold the tiebreaker due to total points, in which they currently hold a 100.4-point edge.
<br/>	
<br/>	So Team Hauloll has marked the tipping point, and the dominos will start falling soon. Remember: there has never been a repeat champion in the history of the JADDL or its predecessor, the Ragin&rsquo; Black Squirrels League. It certainly looks possible on paper this time around, though; Jason not only holds the best overall record in the league&hellip;he&rsquo;s also completely owning the points race, with his closest competition a whopping 124.8 points behind him.
<br/>	
<br/>	The ghost of that black squirrel Jason killed back in the summer of 2006 is cautiously optimistic.
