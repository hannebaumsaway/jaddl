	In an opening week full of intriguing storylines, none are quite as cute as the in-law rivalry between the Bad News Bensons and the Millennium Falcons.<br/>
    <br/>
    There&rsquo;s just one problem: this isn&rsquo;t a rivalry at all. At least not yet.<br/>
    <br/>
    You see, the Bensons (formerly The Return of Ron Mexico) are 3-0 against the Falcons since Ian joined the league. What&rsquo;s more: the gap is widening, not closing in. In 2009 the teams met twice, with Alex winning the first game by six (77-71) and the second by seven (84-77). With the 2010 season in its infancy, Alex went into full-on big brother beatdown mode, ripping Ian by 44, 125.3 - 81.2.<br/>
    <br/>
    This is going to make for an awkward Thanksgiving.<br/>
    <br/>
    Then again, because the Bensons and Falcons are in the same division, Ian will get another crack at his brother from another mother. That rematch comes in Week 9. A win would up Ian&rsquo;s record against his sister&rsquo;s husband to a still-awful 1-3, but hey&hellip;baby steps.<br/>

    Speaking of Ian&rsquo;s sister (and Alex&rsquo;s wife), she&rsquo;s the real victim here; let&rsquo;s not lose sight of that. Every year, she&rsquo;s forced to choose sides between the guy she&rsquo;s related to by blood, and the guy she settled for in marriage. That has to be difficult, right?<br/>
    <br/>
    &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t pick sides beforehand. I just give the loser a bunch of shit, whomever that turns out to be.&rdquo;<br/>
    <br/>
    Sounds like Ian&rsquo;s been taking a lot of shit from his big sister the past couple years. Someone might be in need of a hug.<br/>
    <br/>
    As for the game itself, the Bensons took the first Briefly Badass award of the season with an impressively balanced attack. Cedric Benson was the only player who <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> reach double figures. Damn. On the Falcons&rsquo; side, Ian&rsquo;s going to need more than 14 points from his WR tandem, and certainly more than 8.4 from his QB, to compete for a playoff spot.
