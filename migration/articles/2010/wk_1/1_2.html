    Sure, it&rsquo;s just one week.<br/>
    <br/>
    Yes, there are twelve more weeks to go.<br/>
    <br/>
    But isn&rsquo;t it funny how the same teams keep popping up at the top of the standings year after year? Alright, so maybe The IPA Connoisseur and One Pump Chumps don&rsquo;t quite fall into the category of playoff regulars just yet, but they both made the postseason a year ago. The Bad News Bensons and Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks are playoff mainstays. Team Hauloll is the defending champion, and The Mighty Boom never seems to lose. Ever.<br/>
    <br/>
    So what do these owners have in common that keep them on top?<br/>
    <br/>
    They&rsquo;re all nerds.<br/>
    <br/>
    Lannie, Jason, and Peter are all engineers (as are the usually-dominant Dan and Adam from the Red Hornets and Team Odouls, respectively). Ryan is a computer scientist. Alex works at a medical technology company and made a binder in preparation for the 2009 draft. And Jesse&hellip;well, Jesse&rsquo;s dream girl is Britney Spears.<br/>
    <br/>
    This trend bodes well for Ian: getting your team name from <i>Star Wars</i> is a definite sign of nerdiness.<br/>
    <br/>
    Nolan, Jacob, and James lack the nerdy qualities required to make a fantasy football dynasty. Teaching isn&rsquo;t nerdy at all. Taking care of the elderly? Why, that&rsquo;s damn humanitarian, not nerdy. And James? James is in serious trouble. Lawyers are the subject of countless novels, TV shows, movies, pop culture references, etc. James is perhaps further from nerd than anyone. That would explain his regular appearances at the bottom of the heap.<br/>
    <br/>
    A word to the wise: nerd up to win. I don&rsquo;t see pocket protectors or carpel tunnel; all I see are trophies and bragging rights.
