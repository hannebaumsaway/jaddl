		<li>Kudos to all of you for paying the league entry fee prior to the start of the postseason. A JADDL first!</li><br/>
		<li>Kyle Orton is back in the top 5 in scoring, dammit.</li><br/>
		<li>And neither Payton Manning nor Tom Brady are.</li><br/>
		<li>The West enters the final week of the season with a 6504.7 to 6421.0 lead over the East in total points.</li><br/>
		<li>The East has a higher median value (1109.1) though, so there&rsquo;s that &hellip; which is nice.</li><br/>
		<li>Is there anything in sports more anticlimactic than the college bowl season? You have to wait a month for a bunch of mostly crappy, sparsely attended games. Give me March Madness any day of the week.</li><br/>
		<li>If the Chumps don&rsquo;t make the playoffs, it will be one of the most epic implosions in JADDL history, seeing as how they were in the top 3 in the West every single week &hellip; until Week 12.</li><br/>
		<li>Vegas thinks the odds are good that Hauloll repeats.</li><br/>
