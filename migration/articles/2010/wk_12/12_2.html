    The playoffs are just around the corner, and the attendees are accounted for.
<br/>	
<br/>	&hellip; Most likely.
<br/>	
<br/>	Several teams have indeed already punched their tickets: Team Hauloll and In Pursuit of Perfection from the JADDL West; The Mighty Boom and The Bad News Bensons from the East.
<br/>	
<br/>	The final spots in each division are still technically up for grabs, though only one spot can seriously be considered &ldquo;open.&rdquo; That spot would be in the West, where the last bid will be won in the purest form possible: head-to-head. The Red Hornets hold a one-game lead in overall records over the One Pump Chumps. However, the Chumps have the same divisional record as the Hornets (4-5). And because the league commissioner is so freaking awesome, he had the foresight to set the schedule such that the Hornets and Chumps faced off in Week 13 in a &ldquo;winner goes on, loser goes home&rdquo; battle royale. See, if the Chumps win, that will even up their record with the Hornets&rsquo; at 7-6, and the Chumps would have the better divisional record (and thus, the tiebreaker).
<br/>	
<br/>	As for the rest of the West, unless Hauloll loses to the 3-9 IPA Connoisseur and gets outscored by a victorious IPP by 108.6, Jason can chill until Round 2 of the playoffs with a bye.
<br/>	
<br/>	In the East, no such final bid dramatics exist. The Millennium Falcons hold a one-game edge over the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks in both overall and divisional records, so in the event of a Falcons loss and &rsquo;Shanks victory, the Falcons would still get the bid unless they&rsquo;re outscored by the &rsquo;Shanks by at least 91.7 points. That&rsquo;s &hellip; well, that&rsquo;s just not very likely.
<br/>	
<br/>	The bye in the East is still very much undecided, on the other hand. Boom and the Bensons are deadlocked records-wise, both overall and divisionally, so if one team wins while the other loses, the winner gets the bye. If the same outcome befalls both teams (wins or losses), it&rsquo;ll come down to total points. Boom currently holds a ridiculously narrow 3.1-point lead over the Bensons, so the two teams&rsquo; respective scores in Week 13 will settle the matter in the event the points tiebreaker is necessary.
<br/>	
<br/>	So that&rsquo;s that. Not a whole lot of drama to close out the regular season, but enough to keep you plenty interested.
<br/>	
<br/>	&hellip; Unless you&rsquo;re Jacob, Lannie, Adam, or James, that is.
