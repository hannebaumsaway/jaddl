    Once upon a time, there was a fantasy football owner. For this owner, postseason appearances were an annual occurrence. From his franchise&rsquo;s inaugural season&mdash;2004&mdash;to 2008, he didn&rsquo;t miss the playoffs a single time. He scooped up two championships in that timeframe (&rsquo;05 and &rsquo;08) and established the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks as one of the league&rsquo;s dynasties.
<br/>    
<br/>    Then it all began to fall apart.
<br/>    
<br/>    In 2009, the &rsquo;Shanks seemed to start their title defense with a repeat in mind, coming out of the gate 2-0 with a 110-point average. There was no happy ending to the &rsquo;09 story, however. They followed that 2-0 start with an 0-5 stretch, putting up just 77 points per game and watching their roster collapse before their eyes. LaDainian Tomlinson was a bust; Roy Williams was a bigger bust. Tony Romo was the quintessential &ldquo;hot or cold&rdquo; quarterback, choosing all the wrong games to go cold. In the end, the Longshanks sat at 6-7 and in seventh place, missing the postseason due to being 73.5 points behind The IPA Guzzlers.
<br/>    
<br/>    Fast forward to this season and you&rsquo;ll see a different tale with similar results. The &rsquo;Shanks started out in this new world of divisions with a 32.2-point victory over usually strong Team Odouls. They would be headed back to the playoffs after the one year glitch for sure, right? Not so fast. Two wins and five losses later, the Longshanks found themselves 3-5 after interdivisional play. Even still, they remained in contention for one of the three postseason slots out of the JADDL East. However, they failed for a second time to knock off their primary playoff spot combatant, the Millennium Falcons, and the Bad News Bensons delivered the coup de gr&#0226;ce a week later in the form of a devastatingly painful 0.3-point defeat.
<br/>    
<br/>    &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll blame myself if we don&rsquo;t make the playoffs,&rdquo; said RB Ahmad Bradshaw after the loss to the Bensons. Bradshaw scored just 0.4 despite averaging 12.4 PPG. In a 0.3-point loss, that epic fail of an outing was sickening to &rsquo;Shanks fans. And their owner.
<br/>    
<br/>    &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll blame Ahmad too,&rdquo; said Ryan when asked to address Bradshaw&rsquo;s comment.
<br/>    
<br/>    Despite the crushing setback, the Longshanks aren&rsquo;t <i>technically</i> out of the race yet; not mathematically, anyway. Because the &rsquo;Shanks won this past weekend (85.5 - 71.1 over Football Jesus) and the Millennium Falcons lost, the &rsquo;Shanks moved to a single game back of the Falcons. Should a &rsquo;Shanks victory and Falcons defeat both occur again in the regular season finales this coming weekend, the two teams would be deadlocked records-wise at 6-7 (5-5). But this is where &ldquo;mathematically possible&rdquo; deviates from &ldquo;realistic&rdquo;: the &rsquo;Shanks would also have to overcome the 91.6-point gap that separates them from the Falcons. Let&rsquo;s put that into context: even if the Falcons laid a turd to the tune of, say, 50 points, the Longshanks would still have to score 141.7 to earn a playoff bid. The most the &rsquo;Shanks have scored all year is 114.7, and the least the Falcons have put up is 62.7.
<br/>    
<br/>    Even Lloyd Christmas wouldn&rsquo;t like those odds.
<br/>    
<br/>    So, chances are good the Longshanks will be watching the playoffs from home for the second straight year. Seeing as how the &rsquo;Shanks owner and league commissioner are one and the same, look for a rule change in 2011 giving preferrential treatment to franchises with apostrophes in their names.
