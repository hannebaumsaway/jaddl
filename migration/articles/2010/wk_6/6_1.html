    Sweet Mother Mary, what just happened? (More biblical references coming.) Interdivisional play arrives, and in waltz the East Division teams, touting superior rosters and a significant advantage in total points, and
<br/>    
<br/>    <i>BAM!</i>
<br/>    
<br/>    &mdash;they cower as if before the wrath of God, and proceed to get wiped from the face of the earth.
<br/>    
<br/>    Except, that is, for Lawrence Football Jesus. Jesus, the team that was 1-4 coming in? The team that drew the toughest interdivisional schedule? The team that is owned and managed by James?
<br/>    
<br/>    Yes, that Jesus.
<br/>    
<br/>    He turned water into wine, so why shouldn&rsquo;t Jesus be able to turn a crappy roster into a big W? James picked Alex Smith up off the waiver wire on Thursday morning, and Smith responded with an okay 15.6 points, which is more than starter Carson Palmer averages on the season. Andre Johnson brought the Houston Texans back from the dead (and it took just 15 minutes, not three days), and in doing so, put Da Jesus into victory lane with 19.8 points.
<br/>    
<br/>    Not only was the win much needed by James&rsquo; team, it was necessary to keep the vaunted East Division from going oh-fer on the weekend against the perceived weaker West. The other East franchises lost their cross-country battles by an average of 21 points. An embarrassing way for the standard-bearing division to kick off interdivisional play, for sure.
<br/>    
<br/>    Asked if he was disappointed that his division fared so poorly, James responded, &ldquo;Fuck no. I just gained a full game on everyone in the [East] Division. Jesus will rise again!&rdquo;
<br/>    
<br/>    Now, before we go out and sing hymns in Jesus&rsquo; name, bear in mind that his victim was The IPA Connoisseur, who is now 1-5 on the year.
<br/>    
<br/>    Still, it was a huge win for Jesus, and let he who is without a loss cast the first dismissive comment (that would be nobody, now that Boom has finally fallen).
