    <i>&ldquo;I guarantee the next JADDL champ comes from the East.&rdquo;
<br/>    
<br/>    &ldquo;The East will produce this year&rsquo;s champion. Fuck the West!&rdquo;
<br/>    
<br/>    &ldquo;Do you guys really want to break the league up East/West? That will put all the power in the East.&rdquo;</i>
<br/>    
<br/>    Mmm hmmm. The East: all hat, no cattle thus far.
<br/>    
<br/>    The East Division still leads the border war in points, 3234.8 to 3143.2, but these next few weeks of interdivisional play were supposed to be the difinitive proof of the East&rsquo;s dominance of the JADDL.
<br/>    
<br/>    It didn&rsquo;t quite work out that way.
<br/>    
<br/>    The East went 1-5 over the weekend, with <a href='news/2010/wk_6/index.php?view=news&amp;yr=2010&amp;wk=6&amp;pg=1'>the only victor being then-last place Football Jesus</a>. The West outscored the East 570.6 to 482.9, and handed East powerhouse The Mighty Boom their first loss of 2010 through the work of In Pursuit of Perfection, LLC (127.6 - 85.1).
<br/>    
<br/>    Also among the humiliating notes for the East is the fact that The Flying Pigs scored 73.2 points&hellip;and won (73.2 - 72.7 over the Millennium Falcons). On a related note, the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks gave up just 77.1 points to the Red Hornets, yet lost the game, putting up a pathetic 51.5 points themselves, a total that would make even the Pigs (whose lowest total to date is 52.1) blush.
<br/>    
<br/>    The Bad News Bensons put up the best fight of the losers, going down 92.6 - 88.2 at the hands of the One Pump Chumps.
<br/>    
<br/>    So, what are the repercussions of such an odd weekend?
<br/>    
<br/>    Well, the lone East victor, Football Jesus, gains a full game on every opponent in their division, while Boom whiffed on a golden opportunity to all but lock up a playoff bye. The Falcons and Bensons could have gotten a leg up on the middle of the pack, but instead allowed the pack to become even more muddled with the addition of Jesus, now 2-4.
<br/>    
<br/>    The franchises from the right-hand side of the map are handling this collective setback in various ways. Peter has fined his players fifty thousand imaginary dollars each; he told reporters the players knew that would be the standard penalty for any losses this season. The Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks tried to have a players-only meeting, but Ryan crashed it and forced the players back to the imaginary weight room with no talking allowed.
<br/>    
<br/>    Whatever the East squads&rsquo; issues are, they better get them figured out quickly. Every single game next week is hosted by a West team.
