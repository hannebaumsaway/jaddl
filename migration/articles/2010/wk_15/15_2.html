    That dead black squirrel&rsquo;s dream is officially dead itself.
<br/>	
<br/>	Another JADDL year will soon be in the books; another year without a repeat champion. Defending champ Team Hauloll was ousted from the playoffs by In Pursuit of Perfection 129.5 - 60.2 in their semifinal matchup this past weekend.
<br/>	
<br/>	IPP was led by&mdash;who else?&mdash;Michael &ldquo;Kibbles and&rdquo; Vick, who put up over 40 points for the second time in six weeks. That&rsquo;s insane, by the way. Even more insane is the fact that Vick is the JADDL&rsquo;s overall scoring leader &hellip; despite missing three and a half games early in the season. He&rsquo;s averaging 30 points in games he&rsquo;s played in fully. <i>Averaging</i> 30 freaking points.
<br/>	
<br/>	This also marks the second consecutive week in which IPP has gotten over 40 points from a player; last week it was Darren McFadden. You want to get to the championship game? Have some of your players score over double their season averages in the quarter- and semifinals. That&rsquo;ll usually get you there.
<br/>	
<br/>	As for the loser in this contest, Hauloll&rsquo;s fall ensures that this will be the eigth straight year&mdash;spanning across both the defunct Ragin&rsquo; Black Squirrels League and the JADDL&mdash;without back-to-back champs.
<br/>	
<br/>	
	There&rsquo;s the phenomenon the sports industry dubs &ldquo;peaking at the right time,&rdquo; and then there&rsquo;s what Hauloll did. The 60.2 points they put up in this season-ending effort was their lowest output of the season &hellip; by 30 points. In the end, it may not have mattered though; Hauloll only eclipsed 129.5 once all season anyway, way back in Week 4. Still, you&rsquo;d like to see the defending champs go down swinging; not curled up in the fetal position like a bunch of pussies.

	IPP&rsquo;s victory sets up a fascinating storyline for next weekend&rsquo;s title bout. Vick, marching triumphantly toward ultimate redemption in the form of the Court-Ordered Limousine trophy, and all that stands in his way is the franchise which finally gave up on him after years of <i>dogged</i> loyalty (pun intended). From 2007 to 2009, Alex named his franchise&rsquo;s teams in Vick&rsquo;s honor (Bad Newz Kennels, Leavenworth Law Dogs, The Return of Ron Mexico). Only this year did he put a stop to that tradition, signaling to the league (and to Vick in particular) that he no longer considered the troubled athlete a viable fantasy player.
<br/>	
<br/>	It would seem Vick took it personally.
<br/>	
<br/>	And he&rsquo;ll have a chance to show Alex and the Bensons just what he thinks of them turning their backs on him upon his return to football, on the grandest stage of them all. As if we needed more fuel for this inferno, IPP and the Bensons did meet during intradivisional play earlier this season. The Bensons escaped with an 80-79 win.
<br/>	
<br/>	&hellip; And Vick could do nothing but watch from the sidelines, out with an injury.
<br/>	
<br/>	Yep &hellip; next weekend is going to be a fucking war.
