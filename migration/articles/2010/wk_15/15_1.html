    The third time really is a charm &hellip; for some. For others, not so much.
<br/>	
<br/>	After two miserable losses in the JADDL semifinals in 2007 and 2008, the Bad News Bensons got the proverbial monkey off their backs with a 113.5 - 68.4 victory over The Mighty Boom this past weekend. The long-awaited win puts the Bensons in the JADDL championship game for the first time in franchise history.
<br/>	
<br/>	&ldquo;Well, of course it feels good,&rdquo; said Alex after the game. &ldquo;It feels great to get all those whiny fans off my damn back.&rdquo;
<br/>	
<br/>	The Bensons have never graced the field in the title game despite being the fifth highest scoring franchise in league history. All four of the franchises above them on that list have played in at least one championship game, and three of them have taken home hardware. Being the knowledgeable fantasy football fans they are, the Bad News fanbase knows the numbers, and it hasn&rsquo;t been satisfied by mere regular season wins and point totals. The Bensons finally have given themselves a chance to quench that thirst for a championship.
<br/>	
<br/>	Jamaal Charles continues to be the main piston in the Bensons&rsquo; motor, leading the way with 21 points in the semifinal matchup. Bensons fans held their breath momentarily as Charles writhed on the ground after an 80-yard run, but reports are that they were just cramps, and he should be good to go next weekend.
<br/>	
<br/>	Unfortunately, while the Bensons faithful breath sighs of relief, the Boom fanatics are left to choke on yet another semifinal defeat&mdash;their third in a row.
<br/>	
<br/>	Boom did bring home a championship in 2006, but all that&rsquo;s done is add more pressure to Peter to bring home more. He&rsquo;s got the third winningest franchise in the JADDL, as well as the third highest all-time point total, so his fanbase feels like a single title is inadequate. They&rsquo;re <i>certain</i> a single championship game appearance isn&rsquo;t enough.
<br/>	
<br/>	But this day is all about the Bensons, baby. Their journey culminates with a grand finale against In Pursuit of Perfection and the quizzical quarterback, Michael Vick. A quarterback who has been putting up ridiculous numbers.
<br/>	
<br/>	A quarterback who has a bone to pick with the Bad News Bensons &hellip;
