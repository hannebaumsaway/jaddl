    Well, that celebration was short-lived for the West Division.
<br/>	
<br/>	Just a week after amassing a 5-1 lead in the interdivisional war, owners in the West watched in horror as that lead evaporated completely, leaving in its place a brand new ballgame.
<br/>	
<br/>	Last week the West was 15.5 points away from a clean sweep of East squads to open the three-game cross-country battle. Only a <a href='news/2010/wk_7/index.php?view=news&amp;yr=2010&amp;wk=6&amp;pg=1'>Football Jesus victory over The IPA Connoisseur</a> put a halt to the broom. In an ironic twist only the JADDL can properly produce, it was those same Gridiron Holy Ghosts who stopped the broom once again&hellip;from sweeping in the other direction. A 23.8-point loss to the Red Hornets kept the East from perfection, relegated instead to matching the West&rsquo;s 5-1 mark from the previous week.
<br/>	
<br/>	So here we stand, going into the final week of interdivisional play with the two divisions deadlocked at six wins apiece. Screw TNT; the JADDL <i>knows drama.</i>
<br/>	
<br/>	In terms of points, the East outscored the West 545.0 to 513.2, moving the total interdivisional tally to 1083.8 - 1027.9, still in the West&rsquo;s favor. The season total, however, is still weighted to the East, 3779.8 - 3656.4. A bunch of numbers there, all of which are completely meaningless. That&rsquo;s how the Newsletter rolls.
<br/>	
<br/>	If you recall, another quirk about Week 7 was the fact that every game was played in a West stadium. Just goes to show you that home field advantage means dick in fantasy football, eh? (Seriously, it means nothing in the JADDL, statistically; the commish made sure of that.)
<br/>
<br/>	Also just like a week ago, some of the scores are real head-scratchers. 1-5 Team Odouls <a href='news/2010/wk_7/index.php?view=news&amp;yr=2010&amp;wk=7&amp;pg=1'>dispatched the 4-2 One Pump Chumps by 17</a>. The 2-4 Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks rallied on Monday night from 30 points down to beat 5-1 Team Hauloll by nine. And The Bad News Bensons held on for dear life on that same Monday, surviving a zero-point outing from Roy Williams and escaping with a one-point win over In Pursuit of Perfection, LLC. Here&rsquo;s some salt in the wound for Nolan: Brandon Jacobs had a completely meaningless fumble while trying to run out the clock for the Giants, which of course cost IPP two points&hellip;and victory.
<br/>
<br/>	Not all the games had bizarre outcomes, though. The Millennium Falcons took care of business against the hapless IPA Connoisseur, 106.9 - 90.5. Sometimes bad things happen to bad teams.
<br/>	
<br/>	One week of interdivisional play (and James&rsquo; wet dream) remains, and thanks to this week&rsquo;s vicious retaliation, the East owners may yet be able to back up all the shit they talked during the preseason.
