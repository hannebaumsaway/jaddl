    It was a bleak scene in Houston going into Week 7. Bleak even by Houston&rsquo;s standards. Beloved Team Odouls sat at 1-5 and had to travel to Manhattan to take on the 4-2 One Pump Chumps from the West Division.
<br/>	
<br/>	Fans of the Big O were losing hope for another coveted second-place finish.
<br/>	
<br/>	Then something frickin&rsquo; amazing happened: Thomas Jones scored 18.5 points on Sunday. Then something even amazing-<i>er</i> happened: Todd Heap scored 17.9 points of his own. Then the amazing-<i>est</i> thing happened: Chumps QB Tony Romo went down like the I.Q. of someone having a conversation with his former fling Jessica Simpson, breaking his left clavicle and arresting his fantasy output at a meager 5.4 points.
<br/>	
<br/>	The result of all these amazing happenings? A 99.5 - 82.1 victory for the feisty Near-Beers.
<br/>	
<br/>	&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t be more proud of our guys,&rdquo; gushed Odouls owner Adam after the game. &ldquo;They understand how much those silver Surrendered Keys mean to this franchise, and they went out and did what needed to be done.&rdquo;
<br/>	
<br/>	&hellip;Wait: <i>did what needed to be done?</i> A keen young reporter reminded Adam that his team was still just 2-5 on the season, four games back of The Mighty Boom, and tied for last place in the East.
<br/>	
<br/>	&ldquo;Shut the hell up,&rdquo; Adam replied.
<br/>	
<br/>	2-5 is a whole lot better than 1-6, however, and Adam has a right to remain hopeful for a playoff berth. Or does he? Maybe not. The worst record after seven weeks which produced a playoff team was 3-4 (Team Hauloll in 2008). Good news for The Flying Pigs and the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks; not so good news for Odouls.
<br/>	
<br/>	Oh well. It&rsquo;ll all play itself out soon enough. For now, Adam can revel in the fact that at the very least, he was part of the East Division&rsquo;s collective effort to even the odds in the interdivisional war, <i>unlike the other 2-5 team, Football Jesus.</i> Last week the hero, this week the goat. That is life in the JADDL.
