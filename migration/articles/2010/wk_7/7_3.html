		<li>It&rsquo;s hard to decide which is funnier: Brett Favre&rsquo;s suckiness after being such a freaking drama queen, or the Cowboys&rsquo; collective suckiness after always being a collection of drama queens.</li><br/>
		<li>Not only did a pointless late Brandon Jacobs fumble cost Nolan the W; he also had Darren McFadden on his bench.</li><br/>
		<li>Darren McFadden, in case you didn&rsquo;t see, came off a hamstring injury to abuse the Denver Donkeys with 165 yards rushing, 31 yards receiving, and four touchdowns.</li><br/>
		<li>That equated to 45.6 fantasy points&hellip;none of which did Nolan any good.</li><br/>
		<li>Sitting right next to McFadden on Pursuit&rsquo;s bench was Lee Evans. And his 28.5 points.</li><br/>
		<li>Who&rsquo;s still cracking up about the Raiders waltzing into Invesco Field and gang-raping Denver 59-14?</li><br/>
		<li>Bet Ian&rsquo;s not.</li><br/>
		<li>To answer the first bullet, I&rsquo;m going with the Cowboys. The shots of a dejected/pissed Jerry Jones in the luxury box are priceless.</li><br/>
		<li>More priceless, even, than text messages with pictures of Brett Favre&rsquo;s little party favre (get it? like party <i>favor!</i>).</li><br/>
