	So, it finally happened. James got his wish.<br/>
	<br/>
	Divisions.<br/> 	
	<br/>
	Civil war. East vs. West. Much more work for the league commissioner (thanks James&hellip;dick).<br/>
	<br/>
	We'll see how this goes, but at any rate, divisions are actually happening. At first glance, one would think the power is distributed heavily in the East. The Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks (two titles), the Mighty Boom (one title), Team Odouls (a billion runner-up finishes), and the Bad News Bensons (formerly Return of Ron Mexico, which was formerly Bad Newz Kennels) have all tasted success on to various degrees. Sure, they come packaged with &ldquo;meh&rdquo;-quality teams Football Jesus and Millenium Falcons, but four outta six ain&rsquo;t bad. Besides, the Falcons are coming off their rookie season as a franchise, and all franchises aside from the founding fathers of the league have sucked in their cherry-popping year&hellip;most worse than the Falcons (Mr. Intensity or The Fifth Reich, anyone?).<br/>
	<br/>
	But a deeper dive suggests the power quantity in the East may not actually tip the scale all that much, if at all. Consider this: two of the last three champions reside in the West (the Red Hornets and Team Hauloll). Beyond that, The IPA Connoiseurs and One Pump Chumps are no strangers to the playoffs, though they haven't captured the Limousine to date. As for The Flying Pigs and In Pursuit of Perfection&hellip;well, hope springs eternal.<br/>
	<br/>
	So while the East may have more depth, per se, the West has plenty of punch at the top of its historical hierarchy. Will the season play out as expected, resulting in an all-too-familiar playoff picture, or will the newly introduced rift down the geographic heart of the league mix up the postseason in surprising ways?<br/>
	<br/>
	Well let&rsquo;s find out, shall we? Time to put on the fantasy pads.
