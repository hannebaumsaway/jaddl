    Jason Landoll is a man of honor. A man of his word.
    <br/><br/>
    A man with a secret.
    <br/><br/>
    In the summer of 2006, Landoll was back in his hometown of Marysville, KS, where his family reigns as the local monarchy. Among the many charges of the Landoll clan is the protection of an endangered species: the black squirrel. The punishment for killing a black squirrel in Marysville is death by hanging.
    <br/><br/>
    To date, no one has been charged with said crime. However, 459 black squirrels have been found dead since the Landollian government started keeping track in 1994. As it turns out, actually catching someone in the act of killing a squirrel is really freaking hard.
    <br/><br/>
    Which brings us back to Jason Landoll, owner of Team Hauloll, defending champion of the JADDL, on that fateful night in the summer of 2006. Black is a great color to blend into the night in order to avoid predators. Black isn&rsquo;t such a great color to announce one&rsquo;s presence to oncoming traffic. Landoll tried to swerve in time, but he clipped the squirrel fatally.
    <br/><br/>
    Landoll slammed on his brakes and rushed out to check on the squirrel. As he bent over the little guy&rsquo;s crippled body, the squirrel&rsquo;s eyes flashed in recognition of Marysville&rsquo;s prodigal son, and the soon-to-be-roadkill managed to squeak out a final request:
    <br/><br/>
    &ldquo;Win it all.&rdquo;
    <br/><br/>
    Landoll has been a playoff mainstay since that time, but hadn&rsquo;t fulfilled the rodent&rsquo;s specific plea until last year, when he rode Madden coverboy Drew Brees all the way to the coveted Court-Ordered Limousine. The albatross has been removed from Landoll&rsquo;s neck, but a new one has now taken its place: standard bearer for the new West Division. Jeers are already being leveled at the West from the JADDL fan community as the perceived weaker division, despite hosting the defending champions. A Hauloll repeat would all but shut that perception down.
    <br/><br/>
    Drew Brees will be donning the brown and blue of the Bad News Bensons this season, so Team Hauloll will be counting on the likes of &ldquo;Bangin&rsquo;&rdquo; Tom Brady and Frank Gore to fill the void Brees&rsquo; absence creates. The odds are against them though, as no team has yet driven home the Limo in back-to-back years in JADDL history.
    <br/><br/>
    As for Landoll and the dead black squirrel that is now but a dark, small stain on the highway in northern Kansas? Landoll says the championship last year serves in place of an actual confession to the crime.
    <br/><br/>
    And besides, he asserts, that story was made up anyway&hellip;just a trick to motivate his players. He never <i>actually</i> killed a black squirrel&hellip;honest.
