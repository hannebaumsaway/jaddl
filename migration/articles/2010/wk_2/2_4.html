    	<li>History repeats itself. Team Hauloll, The Mighty Boom, and the One Pump Chumps finished 1st, 3rd, and 4th, respectively, in 2009. This year, they&rsquo;ve all started out 2-0.</li><br/>
		<li>&hellip;But not always. The Red Hornets finished 2nd a year ago, yet sit 0-2 currently. Ironically, so does Team Odouls, the team that <i>normally</i> finishes 2nd.</li><br/>
		<li>Early warning sign: The Mighty Boom may be 2-0 and atop the JADDL East at the moment, but they&rsquo;ve scored the third fewest points in the division.</li><br/>
		<li>Division War update: The East took a commanding lead this week, outscoring the West 658.2 - 454.5. Total tally stands at East 1184.8, West 979.4.</li><br/>
		<li>The Flying Pigs scored 52.1 points this week. Not kidding.</li><br/>
		<li>Hilariously, the Pigs weren&rsquo;t the only West team in the 50s, either (looking at you, Lannie).</li><br/>
		<li>If Vegas ran odds on who would be the top fantasy players after two weeks, what would the odds have been on Jahvid Best and Arian Foster? 500 to 1?</li><br/>
