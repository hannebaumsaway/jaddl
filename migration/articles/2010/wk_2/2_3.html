    A disturbing trend is forming for the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks which has left them with a little less fight and a little long in the face. For the second straight year, the &rsquo;Shanks enter Week 3 of the regular season with a would-be starter on the long-term IR.<br/>
	<br/>
	Last year, the &rsquo;Shanks took a chance on Indianapolis WR Anthony Gonzales, who was battling a nagging injury during the preseason but expected to be ready by the start of the regular season.<br/>
	<br/>
	Eh, no.<br/>
	<br/>
	Gonzales spent the entire year on sidelines, leisurely peddaling the stationary bike while he raked in stacks of cash for doing absolutely nothing; he didn&rsquo;t play a single down the entire year. The Longshanks&rsquo; WR corps was subsequently left thin and scraping for points, and Ryan&rsquo;s squad missed the playoffs for the first time in franchise history.<br/>
	<br/>
	This year&rsquo;s victim is Reggie Bush, who broke his fibula in Monday night&rsquo;s game. Bush was the Longshanks&rsquo; 7th Round pick, the 79th pick overall, and Ryan had planned on playing him a significant number of weeks this season. Now, Bush is likely out at least six weeks, and when he returns, experts say he will probably have lost a step.<br/>
	<br/>
	Fed up with this recurring issue, the Longshanks announced Wednesday that they terminated long-time head trainer Robert Bruce. Bruce had been with the team since the franchise&rsquo;s inception.<br/>
	<br/>
	&ldquo;It saddens me,&rdquo; said Ryan of the firing. &ldquo;It saddens me that Robert turned out to be so terrible at his job. It saddens me that my high caliber athletes are at the mercy of a lazy fat-ass like him. It saddens me that I didn&rsquo;t fire him last year.&rdquo;<br/>
	<br/>
	Bruce could not be reached for comment.
