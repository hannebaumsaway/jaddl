	Last year, James and his ever-changing Obamas lost a nailbiter to Adam and his ever-2nd place Near Beers by a measly 0.1 points after ESPN adjusted their scores, paving the way for a year so bad the Obamas changed their name and demanded divisions.<br/>
<br/>
	This year it looked much the same: Jesus was all but dead with under 2:00 to go against Team Odouls. <br/>
<br/>
	But this is why other people play the game for us.<br/>
<br/>
	The real saint for team Jesus wasn&rsquo;t even on his team. He wasn&rsquo;t on Adam&rsquo;s team either. In fact, he was actually playing <i>against</i> the Saints. It was Vernon Davis, who actually scored 9.8 points for the One Pump Chumps. What the tight end also did is complete a miraculous 2-point conversion for the 49ers to force OT&mdash;with a little divine intervention. The play was originally ruled no good, but a replay overturned the call and gave the Niners the conversion.<br/>
<br/>
	The extra period allowed Jesus&rsquo; kicker Garrett Hartley to kick two game winners (one for Jesus, the other for his Saints), his second and third connections of the game, respectively. <br/>
<br/>
	&ldquo;&rsquo;Bout fuckin&rsquo; time we won a game,&rdquo; said James&mdash;who is 4-11 in his last 15 games&mdash;from his iPad. <br/>
<br/>
	&ldquo;All you gotta do is win your division games,&rdquo; the owner continued. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s fun. That&rsquo;s why we have divisions. You gotta love the divisions. I&rsquo;ve been pushing for divisions for five years now, and I think everyone agrees that divisions are the way to go. Divisions, baby.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
	James and his Jesuses entered Monday night down 10, but with three players left on the fields of the real NFL teams. As expected, they played mediocre in the night game, edging closer to Odoul&rsquo;s century mark, but never looking like they would get over the hump.<br/>
<br/>
	Creeping up to only 2 points down with limited time remaining, Jesus had everything right where James wanted. 1st and goal from the 4, with three chances for Pierre Thomas to punch it in and Reggie Bush on the sideline for the next six weeks. <br/>
<br/>
	As usual, they couldn&rsquo;t get it done. But here came the sad-sack 49ers, ready to take one for the Lord. They somehow managed to march down, get the touchdown, go for 2 and get it, lose the coin toss, and allow the Saints to kick a game-winning field goal as time expired.<br/>
<br/>
	Adam refused to comment on the game, but he did note he was still only one game behind second place in the East Division.
