	Last week, this newsletter acknowledged Alex&rsquo;s brotherly bragging rights after his Bad News Bensons downed Ian&rsquo;s Millennium Falcons. The flip side of that, of course, is the abuse Ian took from his family about being the constant loser in the sibling rivalry.<br/>
	<br/>
	Apparently, Ian took it personally.<br/>
	<br/>
	His Falcons took on the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks this week, and the game was over almost as soon as it began. The score was around 79-16 after the first round of NFL matchups Sunday, and the Falcons reached 100 before the &rsquo;Shanks hit 30 that afternoon.<br/>
	<br/>
	The Longshanks actually ended up with a respectable tally, but it was completely inconsequential. When the Falcons finally pulled their collective foot off the Longshank&rsquo;s throat, the scoreboard read 150.1 - 100.1.<br/>
	<br/>
	In other words, Ian blasted Ryan to a galaxy far, far away.<br/>
	<br/>
	&ldquo;We talked about it, yeah,&rdquo; Falcons RB Jahvid Best said of the disappointment of another loss to Ian&rsquo;s brother-in-law. &ldquo;Apparently Ian&rsquo;s sister has been prank calling him at all times of the night since last weekend, sending texts talking shit, all that stuff. We just wanted to go out there and take out our frustration on someone else.&rdquo;<br/>
	<br/>
	Did they ever.<br/>
	<br/>
	Best scored a career-<i>best</i> (it had to be done) 43.2 points, and was joined by five teammates in double figures. It has yet to be confirmed by the league office, but the Falcons&rsquo; 150.1 mark might be a JADDL record. Regardless, it&rsquo;s a huge total, enough to propel the Falcons to the top of the 1-1 heap in the JADDL East. The Force might be strong with this one.<br/>
	<br/>
	Then again, Best plays for the Lions, so he&rsquo;s unlikely to pop onto the national radar again this year.
