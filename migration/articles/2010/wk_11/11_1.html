    They&rsquo;ve scored the least amount of points in the league. Least by far in their own division.
<br/>	
<br/>	Their best player is Josh Freeman, statistically.
<br/>	
<br/>	They&rsquo;ve scored under 60 <i>four times</i> in 11 weeks of play.
<br/>	
<br/>	Yet somehow, The Flying Pigs are still in the hunt at 5-6 (4-4), just a game back of the two other teams vying for that final West playoff spot, the One Pump Chumps (6-5, 4-4) and Red Hornets (6-5, 3-5). There&rsquo;s only one explanation for this phenomenon:
<br/>	
<br/>	Jacob sold his soul to the devil for a shot to finally make the postseason&mdash;if he makes it, it would be the first appearance with the big boys in franchise history.
<br/>	
<br/>	Let&rsquo;s take a look at the Pigs&rsquo; wins. They score a &ldquo;meh&rdquo; 81.6; IPA falls just short at 80.7. They put up a bad 74.3; the Hornets out-bad them with 72.3. In what amounted to an encore of that, with a different team cast as the victim, the Pigs beat the Falcons two weeks later 73.2 - 72.7. Then they score in the 80s against IPA once again, and IPA fails to eclipse the 70s range.
<br/>	
<br/>	Only this past week did the Pigs win convincingly with a respectable point total, pushing the Chumps closer to the brink of implosion in a 119.2 - 98.6 triumph.
<br/>	
<br/>	On the flip side, most of the Pigs&rsquo; defeats have been lopsided to downright embarrassing. The average point differential in the Avian Oinkers&rsquo; losses? 29.1. Damn. Apparently the devil wants to make it <i>look</i> like he doesn&rsquo;t have his hand on the controls. Or maybe he wants to keep Jacob in his place by reminding him periodically what the Pigs would be reduced to without him. Either way, the floor for this team is in the sub-basement somewhere.
<br/>	
<br/>	But that&rsquo;s irrelevant in the grand scheme of things. The grand scheme, of course, is the postseason; a place the Pigs have never been. What <i>is</i> relevant is the fact that the Pigs can smell it, regardless of the luck it&rsquo;s taken to get them to within sniffing distance (they&rsquo;ve had the second fewest points scored against them in the league, behind the Bad News Bensons). They get the Hornets head-to-head next week, and should they win that game, they&rsquo;d leapfrog the &rsquo;Nets in the West standings due to their superior division record. Furthermore, if the Chumps also lose next weekend&mdash;which is a distinct possibility, considering they play division leader Team Hauloll&mdash;the Pigs would jump <i>them</i> in the standings as well. For those of you who have lost count, that would put the Pigs in third place in their division. Yeah: a projected playoff team.
<br/>	
<br/>	&ldquo;Muahahahahahahahahaahaaaaaaaaa!&rdquo; said Satan.
<br/>	
<br/>	Of course, a loss to the Red Hornets next weekend would put an end to all this, as the Pigs would be mathematically eliminated from the postseason at that point. But hey, as of right now, Jacob can call himself a contender.
<br/>	
<br/>	Oink.
