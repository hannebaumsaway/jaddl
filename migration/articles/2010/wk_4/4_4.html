    	<li>Fun quiz: name the current top five QBs in the league&hellip;</li><br/>
        <li>Peyton&rsquo;s up there, of course (#1), as is Phillip Rivers (#2).</li><br/>
        <li>Expect Brett Favre&rsquo;s interception rate to skyrocket now that Randy Moss is at his disposal; he&rsquo;ll have more confidence than ever to toss &ldquo;WTF?&rdquo; throws in Moss&rsquo; general vicinity.</li><br/>
        <li>Aaron Rodgers is also in the QB Top Five (#5). Can you name the other two?</li><br/>
        <li>&hellip;Drew Brees? Fail.</li><br/>
        <li>Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the last remaining undefeated team in the NFL: your Kansas City Chiefs. Suck it, Ian!</li><br/>
        <li>&hellip;Tom Brady? Nope.</li><br/>
        <li>There won&rsquo;t be a Winless Watch in the JADDL this season; the remaining winless teams&mdash;Team Odouls and The IPA Connoisseur&mdash;picked up victories this past weekend.</li><br/>
        <li>A gap is forming in the East: not only is The Mighty Boom 4-0, there are no 3-1 teams in the division. It&rsquo;s pretty early for a team to jump out to a 2-game lead. Look out.</li><br/>
        <li>&hellip;Tony Romo? Mark Sanchez? Matt Ryan? Epic fail.</li><br/>
        <li>Division War Update: the West wins another battle, 518<sub>0</sub> - 464<sub>5</sub>. That brings the war to 2194<sub>9</sub> - 2056<sub>0</sub> still in the East&rsquo;s favor. But the West is closing in thanks almost entirely to Team Hauloll.</li><br/>
        <li>Oh, and those other two QBs are Michael Vick (#3) and Kyle Orton (#4). Yeah, what the hell?</li><br/>
    </ul>
