    2-2 sounds a hell of a lot better than 1-3.
<br/>	
<br/>	Apparently, Jay Cutler disagrees.
<br/>	
<br/>	Here was the situation: Flying Pigs 76<sub>7</sub>, Red Hornets 61<sub>3</sub>; the Pigs had Cutler remaining, while the only bullet left in the Hornets&rsquo; chamber was its kicker, Stephen Gostkowski. QB vs. Kicker. QB with a 15.4-point cushion.
<br/>	
<br/>	Shit, the fat lady needn&rsquo;t have even warmed up her pipes; the curtain had already dropped. The only question at that point was the margin of the Pigs&rsquo; victory.
<br/>	
<br/>	Well, if that was indeed the question, it&rsquo;s highly doubtful anyone got the answer correct: 2. That&rsquo;s right: Gostkowski outscored Cutler by 13.4 points. And that&rsquo;s not because Gostkowski went off or anything. 11 is a respectable tally for a kicker, to be sure, but hardly enough to strike fear into the heart of an opponent with a 15.4 point lead and a quarterback in his back pocket.
<br/>	
<br/>	His back pocket is where Jacob should have left Cutler.
<br/>	
<br/>	The monumental douchebag (once you play in Denver, you&rsquo;re forever a douche&hellip;also, Cutler really <i>is</i> a d-bag, by all accounts) was disastrous from the start. They say quarterbacks have to have a clock in their heads to time how long they have before the pass rush arrives. If that&rsquo;s true, Cutler must&rsquo;ve forgotten to wind his. He was sacked nine times&hellip;<i>in the first half.</i> He was sacked right past zero and into Negative Numbers Land. An interception and three fumbles helped pave the way into that dark abyss, as well.
<br/>	
<br/>	But the Pigs caught a break just before their golden chariot transformed fully into a pumpkin: Cutler never came back into the game after halftime. Who knows how much more damage he could have done to Jacob&rsquo;s squad? Luckily for Jake, the New York Giants did enough damage to Cutler&rsquo;s head to keep the answer a mystery. Cutler did his best to yank his team down to 1-3, but as usual, his best wasn&rsquo;t good enough (Vanderbilt called: they want to know where those bowl appearances Jay led them to are).
<br/>	
<br/>	So the Pigs climb to 2-2, and a .500 mark four games into the season is more than satisfactory for the normally defunct Pigs. Now they just have to find a new QB for Week 5 and beyond, because Jay Cutler went &ldquo;Wee! Wee! Wee!&rdquo; all the way to the infirmary.
