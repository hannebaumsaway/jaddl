	Randy Moss will have the same quarterback he&rsquo;s had this entire season. Same running backs. Same wide receiver colleagues. Same owner.
<br/>    
<br/>    Yet he won&rsquo;t, at the same time.
<br/>    
<br/>    As of Tuesday night, rumors exploded on the Interwebs about a possible trade&mdash;in the NFL, not the JADDL. This trade would send Randy Moss from the Patriots to the Vikings in exchange for a third round pick. By Wednesday morning, the Twittersphere made the trade sound imminent.
<br/>    
<br/>    So, the cast of characters surrounding Moss IRL (&ldquo;in real life&rdquo; for you non-nerds&mdash;a.k.a. bad fantasy football owners) will change drastically. Gone will be the flowing golden-brown locks of Tom &ldquo;Bangin&rsquo;&rdquo; Brady, and in will come the gray bearded, Wrangler-sportin&rsquo; Brett Favre, nicknamed the &ldquo;Gunslinger&rdquo; because he&rsquo;s actually old enough to have starred in a few old westerns alongside John Wayne. Oh, that isn&rsquo;t the reason? Well, it ought to be.
<br/>    
<br/>    Also gone will be the so-so running game of New England, supplanted by the formidable ground attack of Minnesota, the 5th best rushing team in the NFL. Sure, &ldquo;All Day&rdquo; hasn&rsquo;t been quite as dominant as years past, because Favre makes sure the show in town is all about Favre, but it&rsquo;s still more than Moss had to put up with from the likes of&hellip;who is New England&rsquo;s premiere back, anyway? Is Kevin Faulk still lurking around there these days?
<br/>    
<br/>    While his NFL family undergoes a complete turnover, Moss&rsquo; <i>fantastic</i> family remains the same. When he dons the jet-black Boom unis, he&rsquo;ll still be looking down the line at Joe Flacco under center (unless he gets swapped for flavor-of-the-month Kyle Orton, that is). He&rsquo;ll still be competing for touches with Matt Forte, Malcolm Floyd, and Mike Williams.
<br/>    
<br/>    And he&rsquo;ll still have the comfort of being led into battle by one of the most unrelenting, ruthless, competitive sons of bitches to ever grace the gridiron.
<br/>    
<br/>    Not Bill Belichick&hellip;
