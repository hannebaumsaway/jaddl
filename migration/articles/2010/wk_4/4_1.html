	Well, that didn&rsquo;t take long.
<br/>	
<br/>	As was alluded to in this newsletter a week ago, the One Pump Chumps were a paper tiger among the remaining unbeatens, just waiting to fall. It happened sooner than later, but OPC has nothing to be ashamed of. After all, the loss came at the hands of the defending champs. And let&rsquo;s be real: it&rsquo;s the Chumps we&rsquo;re talking about here&hellip;they weren&rsquo;t going undefeated. Hey Jesse: did you go undefeated in that &ldquo;2005 season&rdquo; you made up&mdash;er, speak of?
<br/>	
<br/>	At any rate, on to the victors of this contest: the oft-victorious Boys of Black Squirrelsville, now 3-1 and back on top of the JADDL world&hellip;at least the western half of it. Hauloll&rsquo;s 460.8 total points dwarf the other West Division combatants, the closest (In Pursuit of Perfection) sitting at 376.7.
<br/>	
<br/>	That&rsquo;s not to pick on the Not-So-Wild West, however. The members of the East stack up just as poorly to the reigning Limo driver from Scottsdale. The only undefeated team remaining, The Mighty Boom (who else?), has accrued 78.6 less points than Hauloll. The Millennium Falcons are the only other team in either division to eclipse the 400 mark to date.
<br/>	
<br/>	The Boomers are the only remaining undefeated team, by the way, because Hauloll dispatched of the Chumps personally this past weekend, 131<sub>0</sub> - 84<sub>9</sub>. Good things tend to happen when your sixth round draft pick is the second leading scorer in the league. That&rsquo;s where RB Arian Foster sits, just behind Peyton &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s The&rdquo; Manning. The kid runs with so much anger, with such abandon, it&rsquo;s incredible. Perhaps all that rage stems from all those years ago, when his mom forgot the &lsquo;d&rsquo; when trying to write &ldquo;Adrian&rdquo; on his birth certificate.
<br/>	
<br/>	Whatever the reason, Foster has the champs in good shape a third of the way into the season, which may be too early to ask this question: are we looking at the best chance to date for the world&rsquo;s first repeat JADDL champion? Hauloll is almost certain to make the playoffs, but after that&mdash;when they have to mix it up with counterparts from the East&mdash;anything can happen.
<br/>	
<br/>	In any case, the fine people of Marysville, KS, are stoked&hellip;even Jason&rsquo;s royal relatives, most likely, though they are forbidden by law to show emotion. A second consecutive Limousine would be sure to have them cracking hidden grins all over the freakin&rsquo; place. Pandemonium!
