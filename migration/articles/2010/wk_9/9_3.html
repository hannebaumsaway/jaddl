		<li>The <a class='ajaxLink' href='news/2010/wk_9/landing.php?view=standings&amp;which=9&amp;page=projected&amp;ajax=y'>projected playoffs</a> page is up. Be aware that the one on the ESPN league site may be wrong, if we get teams with identical overall records, but one has a better division record and less points than the other, the ESPN projections will be incorrect, since we&rsquo;re using division record as the first tiebreaker.</li><br/>
		<li>The Newsletter Curse strikes again! A week after headlining, the Red Hornets were stung by Team Hauloll, by an excrutiatingly thin margin (0.4 points). Bad news for Jesse&hellip;</li><br/>
		<li>That narrow defeat was huge for the Hornets, as it moved them from &ldquo;in&rdquo; to &ldquo;out&rdquo; in the current playoff picture.</li><br/>
		<li>Have you ever seen a more poorly officiated game than the one in Oakland Sunday? Good lord. Todd Haley practically had to chuck a down marker javellin-like at the ref to get him to correct the down-and-distance.</li><br/>
		<li>Kyle Orton finally dropped out of the top 5 in scoring. Now, if we can just get Peyton Hillis out of the top 10, all will be right with the world.</li><br/>
		<li>Speaking of all being right with the world, K-State beat Texas. Again. Yawn.</li><br/>
		<li>Impressive fourth quarter comeback by the Fighting Turner Gills as well.</li><br/>
