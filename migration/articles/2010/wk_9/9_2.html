    In sports, for whatever reason, there are certain teams that have other teams&rsquo; numbers no matter the situation or year. Texas can&rsquo;t seem to beat K-State. Nebraska can&rsquo;t seem to beat Texas.
<br/>	
<br/>	And Ian can&rsquo;t seem to beat Alex.
<br/>	
<br/>	The Millennium Falcons crumbled at the feet of the Bad News Bensons yet again this weekend, losing 89.9 - 83.2, which dropped Ian&rsquo;s all-time record against his brother-in-law to 0-4. Now, unless he wants to get hazed by his sister all offseason, Ian must pray that the JADDL East standings stay as they are today, which would give the Falcons a third shot at Bad News in the wild card round of the playoffs. But, if past performance is an indicator of future results, that might be bad news for Ian indeed.
<br/>	
<br/>	One Falcons player is even more pissed off about the loss than usual this week: murderer Ray Lewis. His Ravens D/ST unit collected 12 points, but watched them go to waste on the bench while the starting Lions D/ST managed just four points.
<br/>	<img alt="" src='http://assets.espn.go.com/media/motion/2009/0129/com_090129nfl_RayLewis1v.jpg' align='right' style='margin:30 0 30 30;' width=410 />
<br/>	12 - 4 = 8.
<br/>	
<br/>	8 + 83.2 = 91.2.
<br/>	
<br/>	91.2 > 89.9.
<br/>	
<br/>	Ouch.
<br/>	
<br/>	&ldquo;Fuckin&rsquo; eh right, &lsquo;ouch,&rsquo;&rdquo; spat Lewis following the game. &ldquo;I start, we win. Simple as that. Who the fuck starts the Lions D over me? Are you shittin&rsquo; me? Ian needs to slap on some Old Spice and get his head in the fuckin&rsquo; game.&rdquo;
<br/>	
<br/>	Coincidentally, the last time the Ravens D/ST started for the Star Wars Nerds was in a 73.2 - 72.7 loss to The Flying Pigs. Lewis&rsquo; D/ST contributed six points in the losing effort.
<br/>	
<br/>	&ldquo;That was then, this is now, mother fucker.&rdquo;
<br/>	
<br/>	Lewis is right. That was when Ian was 0-3 versus Alex. Now he&rsquo;s 0-4.
<br/>	
<br/>	Ian dismissed Lewis&rsquo; comments, saying he&rsquo;s happy his players don&rsquo;t accept losing and get emotional about their team. However, cautioned Yoda, &ldquo;Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.&rdquo;
<br/>	
<br/>	So, does Ian want another shot at his bro in the playoffs, or would he prefer to escape that rematch for fear of a recurring outcome?
<br/>	
<br/>	&ldquo;Escape is not his plan,&rdquo; says Darth Vader.
<br/>	
<br/>	&ldquo;Fear is the path to the Dark Side,&rdquo; Yoda agreed.
