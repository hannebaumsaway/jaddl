    Three teams from the West Division will earn the right to compete in the playoffs.
<br/>	
<br/>	Two times have the One Pump Chumps and In Pursuit of Perfection, LLC met this season to battle it out for that right.
<br/>	
<br/>	One team won both of those matchups.
<br/>	
<br/>	Zero times was that team IPP.
<br/>	
<br/>	The two oft-acronymed squads hooked up way back in Week 1, with OPC emerging victorious, 87.9 - 71.2. A lot has happened since then, events which put both OPC and IPP in position to qualify for the postseason. Coming into the rematch this past weekend, OPC and IPP had identical records, 5-3 overall and 3-2 in the division; IPP held the tiebreaker edge with a sizeable 145.5-point advantage in total points.
<br/>	
<br/>	An advantage that is currently meaningless due to the outcome of the rematch, an outcome remarkably similar to the first time around: 94.7 - 72.1, Chumps. OPC was powered by Matthew &ldquo;I have a hot sister&rdquo; Stafford, David Akers, and the Saints&rsquo; D/ST. If I had a nickel for every time I said that sentence&hellip;.The win moves the Chumps ahead of IPP in the league standings, and with just four weeks left in the regular season, every win is vitally important. Tell Jesse something he <i>doesn&rsquo;t</i> know.
<br/>	
<br/>	&ldquo;We finally made it back to the playoffs last year, but had an embarrassingly pathetic showing there,&rdquo; said Jesse. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going back this year, and we&rsquo;re going to make some noise when we get there! A lot of noise! Louder than a Britney concert!&rdquo;
<br/>	
<br/>	&hellip;Yeah, that&rsquo;s probably not going to happen. For one, the Chumps are far from a lock to even make the playoffs at this point, despite sitting in second place in the division at 6-3 (4-2). IPP and the ever-dangerous Red Hornets are lurking just behind at 5-4, and though both teams have worse division records than OPC, both have significantly more total points if it comes down to the second tiebreaker. Plus, the Chumps still have to play the Hornets and division leader Team Hauloll once more before all is said and done.
<br/>	
<br/>	Even if the Chumps get to the playoffs, they won&rsquo;t necessarily be bringing a championship-caliber team with them. OPC has scored the second-fewest points in the division, ahead of only the scoring-adverse Flying Pigs (who are, however, amazingly still mathematically alive in the hunt at 4-5). The road to the title game for the Chumps goes through Phoenix and Hauloll, a team that crushed OPC by 46 in their first meeting.
<br/>	
<br/>	So, in the event the Chumps earn a playoff bid for the second straight year, the chances are good they&rsquo;ll get sent home early, leaving Jesse to say &ldquo;Oops! I did it again&hellip;&rdquo;
