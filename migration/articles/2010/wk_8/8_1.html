    Starting off the season with two straight losses isn&rsquo;t usually a recipe for success. Nor is a 1-3 beginning after four weeks.
<br/>	
<br/>	Dan doesn&rsquo;t care about any of that, now.
<br/>	
<br/>	After four straight wins&mdash;and five wins in the last six games&mdash;his Red Hornets are 5-3 and in third place in the JADDL West. This is a far more familiar position for the Fighting Gingers, who have made the playoffs in two of the past three years and have two Court-Ordered Limousines under their belts.
<br/>	
<br/>	The &rsquo;Nets are led by a traditional fantasy football powerhouse: Sebastian Janikowski. Janikowski embodies the cunning, fire, and reckless abandon&mdash;which some would call absolute bat-shit craziness&mdash;of his team&rsquo;s owner. The placekicking Polish man with the polished head has scored in double figures in six of his eight games. For a kicker, that&rsquo;s damn near unnatural.
<br/>	
<br/>	&ldquo;Jestem prawie niesamowite, co mog&#X119; powiedzie&#X107;,&rdquo; Janikowski said about himself. &ldquo;Mam nogi boga, a kobiety kochaj&#X105; mnie.&rdquo;
<br/>	
<br/>	Asked if he would agree with Janikowski&rsquo;s self-assessment, Dan replied, &ldquo;Yes, I think that&rsquo;s a fair statement.&rdquo;
<br/>	
<br/>	Though the Hornets have averaged an impressive 97.5 points per game over the past four games, the story behind the Ginger Stingers&rsquo; winning streak goes a bit beyond their own scoring spree. Their opponents have only averaged 74.8 PPG over that same stretch. Good scoring of your own + bad scoring by your opponents = winning streak. JADDL Math 101.
<br/>	
<br/>	The Hornets&rsquo; latest conquest was a 119.1 - 89.4 victory over the scrappy Bad News Bensons (4-4). Larry Fitzgerald led the way with 19.2 points, but it was a balanced attack overall, with similar contributions from Peyton Manning, Terrell Owens, Mercedes Lewis, and&mdash;of course&mdash;Janikowski. Fitzgerald? Owens? What is this, 2008?
