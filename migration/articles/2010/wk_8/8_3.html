		<li style='color:#900;'>Only one owner has yet to pay the league entry fee. I won&rsquo;t name names, but he lives in Arizona and he isn&rsquo;t a daywalker.</li><br/>
		<li>How do you like the rolling Jared quotes above? Of course, you can&rsquo;t see them in IE, for any of you losers still using IE.</li><br/>
		<li>No home-cookin&rsquo; for the commish: a meaningless fumble by Matt Schaub with a minute to go in the Houston-Indy game gave the Colts D/ST three points&hellip;which gave the Chumps a 0.3-point victory over the &rsquo;Shanks.</li><br/>
		<li>&hellip;Fucking fuck.</li><br/>
		<li>Ironic side note? Schaub was on the Longshanks&rsquo; bench at the time. Apparently, he wasn&rsquo;t too happy about it, and decided to punish Ryan because of it.</li><br/>
		<li>Soooo&hellip;the Vikings released Randy Moss. What the hell is going on up there in Minnesota? Jared would like to know.</li><br/>
		<li>Three teams scored under 50 this week; that might be a JADDL first.</li><br/>
		<li>The top of the player leaderboard is beginning to look more familiar, with Peyton Manning, Phillip Rivers, and Adrian Peterson in the top five. However, Arian Foster and Kyle Orton are still screwing things up by being up there as well.</li><br/>
		<li>Rarely does Jacob get a calm weekend: his Pigs have been involved in four games that were decided by 2.1 points or less.</li><br/>
