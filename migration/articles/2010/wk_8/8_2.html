    Well, well, well, those cheeky Western bastards!
<br/>	
<br/>	They sat back and listened to all the shit being talked from the righthand side of the table in the preseason. They bided their time and struck when given the chance, going 5-1 against the East in the first week of interdivisional play. When the East struck back in the second week, the West sat back and listened to more shit, the whole time with smiles on their faces.
<br/>	
<br/>	They knew something the rest of the JADDL community apparently didn&rsquo;t. <i>They knew they were the better division.</i>
<br/>	
<br/>	Given the chance to prove it, the West did just that in the final week of the cross-country war, going 5-1 against Eastern teams yet again to close out interdivisional play with a decisive 11-7 advantage in head-to-head competition. In this phase of battle, the West outscored the East 541.2 to 427. In other words, they beat the bejeezus out of them.
<br/>	
<br/>	The matchups appeared on paper to be remarkably even. 4-3 Chumps vs. 3-4 &rsquo;Shanks; 4-3 Hornets vs. 4-3 Bensons; 4-3 IPP vs. 4-3 Falcons; 2-5 Odouls vs. 3-4 Pigs. Those games, for the most part, lived up to expectations by producing tightly-contested outcomes. The average margin of victory in those four games? 12 points. The other two games looked to be lopsided, and were; but only one of them in the anticipated direction. 5-2 Hauloll took out 2-5 Jesus by 51.2; no surprise there. However, 1-6 Connoisseur stunned the 6-1 Mighty Boom, upsetting them by 19.1 points.
<br/>	
<br/>	Boom joins the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks as easily the most disappointing teams from the Eastern half of the JADDL world. Those two franchises are the only ones from the East that have championships on their r&#0233;sum&#0233;s, and they flat didn&rsquo;t show up for interdivisional play. Both went 1-2 over the three weeks; the &rsquo;Shanks averaged a putrid 66.6 points per game, while Boom clocked in at a not-much-better 73.8. The Mighty Boom and Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks? Psh&hellip;more like <i>The Flighty Poon</i> and <i>Cryin&rsquo; Dongspanks.</i>
<br/>	
<br/>	The West had no such trouble getting its flagship teams to show up. Team Hauloll went 2-1 over the three games, as did the One Pump Chumps and In Pursuit of Perfection. The real heroes for the West, though, were the Red Hornets, who went 3-0 against East foes.
<br/>	
<br/>	Said Hornets owner Dan prior to the start of the season: &ldquo;Perhaps the East has already forgotten that the championship was entirely in Phoenix last year.&rdquo; Apparently, Dan felt the need to send a reminder of that fact over the past three weeks.
