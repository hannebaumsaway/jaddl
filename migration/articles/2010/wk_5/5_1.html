    Hey Pete: <i>enough</i> already.
<br/>	
<br/>	Seriously, this whole &ldquo;Hey, look how good I am!&rdquo; schtick is beyond old. We get it: you&rsquo;re incredibly dominant in the regular season, as exhibited by your 27-4 record since the start of the 2008 season (you did go 3-9-1 in 2007, so <i>ha!</i>).
<br/>	
<br/>	27 and fucking 4.
<br/>	
<br/>	Whatever. How&rsquo;s that working for ya in the postseason, Peter? What&rsquo;s that? You haven&rsquo;t won a single playoff game since 2006? That&rsquo;s right, beeyotch: 22-4 the past two regular seasons, 0-2 the past two postseasons. BOOM, roasted.
<br/>	
<br/>	End rant.
<br/>	
<br/>	With that out of the way, it&rsquo;s time to give credit where credit is due: The Mighty Boom is mighty once again (that fucker). Despite sitting at 4-0 a week ago, there remained some doubt across the league as to whether this Boom squad was in the same tier as the last two versions. They averaged 95.6 points per game, but had scored under 85 twice; it just so happened that their opponents in those two games both scored under 75 themselves, allowing Boom&rsquo;s record to remain unblemished at 5-0 despite subpar outings.
<br/>	
<br/>	The doubters are few and far between, now. The Mighty upped their average to 105.4 with a 144<sub>6</sub> - 90<sub>7</sub> undressing of the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks (2-3). Matt Forte responded to two horrific weeks with a 32.8-point explosion, and Malcom (sic) Floyd continues to reap the benefits of a nonexistent San Diego running game.
<br/>	
<br/>	And Peter doesn&rsquo;t just have talent; he has an embarrassment of riches. Boom&rsquo;s <i>bench</i> scored 76.6 points, which would have beaten two JADDL teams in Week 5. Granted, those teams were The Flying Pigs and Football Jesus, but still. 11 of the 17 players on Boom&rsquo;s complete roster put up double-digit tallies, three of whom scored over 20.
<br/>	
<br/>	The Longshanks&rsquo; feeble attempt to counter was led with 57 points from their receivers, but was quelled by a 3.7-point effort from disappointing Matt Schaub and -4 from the Chargers D/ST.
<br/>	
<br/>	Peter doesn&rsquo;t just get talent; he excels at getting maximum value from that talent&hellip;even if it means some shady dealings. The Patriots&rsquo; bye was this week, and the Vikings had theirs in Week 4. Why is this relevant? Because had Randy Moss stayed with the Pats another week or been traded to Minnesota a week earlier, The Boom would have missed a week of his production, like every other fantasy team has to endure with every other player. But no: Peter worked diligently behind closed doors with the GMs from both NFL franchises to make the Moss trade happen at precisely the right moment, to ensure that The Mighty Boom got 13 weeks&rsquo; worth of Moss&rsquo; points in the regular season.
<br/>	
<br/>	That's really awesome, Pete. The other owners are totally stoked for you, bro. (Bastard.)
