    	<li>Have you seen the Franchise Bios yet?</li><br/>
		<li>The East outscored the West 556.8 to 516.6 this week.</li><br/>
		<li>How on God's green earth have The Flying Pigs won two games? They've scored under 60 <i>three times</i>, and their highest score to date is 81.6 in Week 1.</li><br/>
		<li>To put that into perspective, Hauloll has yet to score under 100, and their lowest score to date is 101.5. Ironically, that low point came against the Pigs head-to-head in Week 2. Not surprisingly, Hauloll slaughtered the Pigs, 101<sub>5</sub> - 52<sub>1</sub>.</li><br/>
		<li>Who's going to win the Sunflower <i>Slow</i>down this Thursday? The team that lost to North Dakota State at home, or the team that has the kid on the cover of <i>M.A.D.</i> magazine as its quarterback?</li><br/>
		<li>Kyle Orton is still #3 in the league in points, by the way. The world will make a little less sense each week this continues.</li><br/>
		<li>Did you hear the &ldquo;We want Carr!&rdquo; chant during the San Fran game? Hilarious. The Niners fans seemed almost disappointed when Alex Smith responded with a touchdown drive.</li><br/>
