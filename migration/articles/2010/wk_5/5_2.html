    Here we go. The moment everyone has been waiting for&mdash;and by &ldquo;everyone&rdquo; I mean James&mdash;the time when divisional foes temporarily join forces to take on strangers from the other side of the JADDL universe.
	<br/><br/>
	These interdivisional games are less important than intradivisional ones (pay attention: those are two different words), yet carry with them a festival-like atmosphere for some odd reason. Fans get all sorts of jacked up for them, and James will probably have a three-week-long orgasm. Gross.
	<br/><br/>
	Anyway, to celebrate this new phenomenon making its first appearance in the JADDL, here&rsquo;s a little heads up on the status of the divisions heading into the cross-country clash, and what to watch for over the coming few weeks:
	<br/>
	<ul>
		<li>The West Division is an odd duck: it&rsquo;s more congested records-wise than the East, with every team within three or less games of first place; yet, it&rsquo;s more disparate in terms of points, with both the highest score in the entire league (Team Hauloll, 563.6) and the lowest (The Flying Pigs, 324.8).</li><br/>
		<li>The first week of interdivisional play should tell us a lot about the strength of each division, as the matchups are remarkably balanced. Three of the six games feature teams with identical records (Hornets v. &rsquo;Shanks, Connoisseur v. Jesus, Bensons v. OPC). Another pairs up two teams with winning records (Boom v. IPP). Only one game looks to be severly lopsided on paper&mdash;er, screen: Hauloll (4-1) v. Odouls (1-4).</li><br/>
		<li>Schedule shenanigans: in the second week of interdivisional play, every single West team gets to play at home. Don&rsquo;t worry, it&rsquo;s even overall however, with each division hosting nine games total.</li><br/>

			Notice the two teams with the easiest schedules from their respective divisions. Yeah&hellip;what a bunch of bullshit. Hauloll and The Boomers could secure playoff spots at the expense of crappy opponents from across the league divide. On the flip side, The Flying Pigs&rsquo; and Football Jesus&rsquo; seasons might not survive the next few weeks, making the return to divisional play just a delay of the inevitable playoff whiff.

			Memorable preseason quotes from franchise owners during the divisions debate:<br/><br/>
			<ul>
				<li>&ldquo;I guarantee the next JADDL champ comes from the East.&rdquo;<br/><i>Adam</i></li><br/>
				<li>&ldquo;The East will produce this year&rsquo;s champion. FUCK THE WEST!&rdquo;<br/><i>James</i></li><br/>
				<li>&ldquo;Perhaps the East has already forgotten that the championship was entirely in Phoenix last year.&rdquo;<br/><i>Dan</i></li><br/>
				<li>&ldquo;Chiefs suck.&rdquo;<br/><i>Ian</i></li><br/>
				<li>&ldquo;I am fucking super excited about divisions! I think the League really stepped up this year.&rdquo;<br/><i>James</i></li><br/>
				<li>&ldquo;James had me proofread that proposal [for divisions] yesterday. The girls I sit next to at work were like, &lsquo;WTF are you working on?&rsquo;&rdquo;<br/><i>Alex</i></li><br/>
