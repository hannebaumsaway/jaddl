	Let&rsquo;s get the obvious out of the way: The Mighty Boom set&mdash;nay, shattered&mdash;the single season scoring record this year. [Insert we-landed-on-the-moon.gif here.] They could have taken Weeks 12 and 13 off completely and <i>still</i> done so. That&rsquo;s right: after Week 11, Boom had 1,500.7. The scoring record, up to now, was 1,460.4, set by Team Odouls in 2014.<br>
<br>
	That&rsquo;s now ancient history. The new record is 1,756.5, and good luck to anyone chasing it in the future. You probably aren&rsquo;t going to get Patrick Mahomes II in the 8th round; just a hunch. Without looking, can you guess how many games under 100 points Boom had this year?<br>
<br>
	That wasn&rsquo;t a trick question; the answer is zero. No double-digit games. None. That&rsquo;s a JADDL first.<br>
<br>
	Let&rsquo;s find some more insane stats with which to slobber all over Peter&rsquo;s peter! There are so many.<br>
<br>
	Boom&rsquo;s lowest score this season was 112.5. The Tulsa Angry Monkeys&rsquo; <i>highest</i> score was 113.7, as a fun little comparison. The Mighty now own two of the top five largest margins of victory in league history thanks to this season alone.<br>
	<div class="news-quote">The Mighty Boom quite simply redefined what domination looks like in the JADDL.</div><br>
	Ironically, one of the records Boom <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> break this year was one it already holds: highest single-game score. The 188.9 Boom scored in 2012 may hold up for a looooonnnnng time. (Boom <i>did</i> score 173.7 in Week 1 this year, though, which is good for second all-time.)<br>
<br>
	And the other achievement that eluded the Boomers was that white whale which has haunted the league since its inception: the undefeated season. How this 2018 Boom team lost a game will baffle historians for years to come, but chalk it up to the old adage that anything can happen in a rivalry game, as Boom dropped the Velvet Rivalry in Week 4. Road games in the JADDL, man.<br>
<br>
	But before we go <i>too</i> deep in Boom&rsquo;s jock, we have to note the other obvious thing about this season: it was high scoring across the board.<br>
<br>
	Hilariously, had the fictional Mighty Boom squad&rsquo;s fictional team plane We-Are-Marshall&rsquo;d into a fictional field somewhere during the year, the single-season scoring record would have still been broken&mdash;by Team Hauloll, which scored 1,489.1 itself. The Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks&rsquo; 2018 campaign clocks in at fifth on the all-time list. James pointed out the absurdity that his Jesus team&mdash;the highest scoring Football Jesus team in history&mdash;only scored fewer than 96 points once all year, and all that got them was a .500 divisional record and a seat on the couch for the playoffs.<br>
<br>
	Five of the twelve teams in the league set their franchise records for scoring in a season this year&mdash;Boom, Jesus, the Shanks, Team Hauloll, and AmariCarr (okay, that last one doesn&rsquo;t really count, but hey).<br>
<br>
	For more context, check out the average points per game for the top five all-time scoring seasons:<br>
<br>
	2015: 92.8<br>
	2009: 92.9<br>
	2013: 93.0<br>
	2014: 93.2<br>
	<b>2018: 101.2</b><br>
<br>
	That&rsquo;s quite the leap.<br>
<br>
	So given the global scoring surge, just how impressive was Boom&rsquo;s season, truly? Let&rsquo;s try to normalize this thing. In terms of the percentage of the league total the points leaders were responsible for year over year, the 2018 Mighty Boom team ranks&hellip;<br>
<br>
	Yeah, they rank first, you guys. Boom scored 11.1 percent of the league&rsquo;s points this season, which was, as we&rsquo;ve covered extensively, the highest scoring season of all time. Every other points leader&rsquo;s contribution since 2007 made up between 9.6 and 10.1 percent of the total.<br>
<br>
	Slice it up any way you want. It&rsquo;s impossible to marginalize what Boom has done this season. It can&rsquo;t be dismissed, brushed aside, minimized, or forgotten. The Mighty Boom quite simply redefined what <i>domination</i> looks like in the JADDL.<br>
<br>
	And they did so in one of the most entertaining seasons yet, according to fans everywhere. The entire West Division was within a game of each other for seemingly 13 weeks. Well, except for the Red Hornets. The defending champion Longshanks, on the brink of mathematical elimination, rattled off three straight wins by scoring 132 points per game over that stretch, forcing a Week 13 elimination game between the Bad News Bensons and Jesus.<br>
<br>
	You had early bouts of Fitzmagic. Le&rsquo;Ve-off Bell. The fall and rise of Amari Cooper. Patty Ice Mahomes and Tyreek Hill. The inexplicable trade of Antonio Brown. The immortal Drew Brees. Young dudes like Saquon Barkley and Christian McCaffrey doin&rsquo; work.<br>
<br>
	And Boom. Mighty, booming, bedazzling, beast-mode Boom. As intimidating a team as the world has ever seen. A roster with QB1, RB1, WR1, DST1&mdash;and hell, WR2, K2, and TE3 just for the hell of it. RB15 rides Boom&rsquo;s bench.<br>
<br>
	Peter, if you don&rsquo;t win the Limousine, it will be the chokiest choke job since 1998 in St. Louis.<br>
<br>
	No pressure.
