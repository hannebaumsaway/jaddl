	Nestled in the unassuming foothills of the Ozark Mountains, the big little town of Tulsa, Oklahoma, quietly goes about its day. The rhythmic murmur of the Arkansas River seems to be the only thing passing the time in the city once dubbed &ldquo;The Oil Capital of the World.&rdquo; Tulsa can at once seem like a town of forty thousand and a city of four hundred thousand.<br/>
    <br/>
    But whatever else Tulsa may feel like, lately, it&rsquo;s been drenched in eager, nervous anticipation. Something big is happening in Tulsey Town. Could happen. <i>Should</i> happen.<br/>
    <br/>
    When a JADDL franchise fell into the city&rsquo;s lap a few years ago, Tulsa citizens didn&rsquo;t know what to think. The Flying Pigs weren&rsquo;t exactly a dynasty, nor were they a household name or merchandising machine nationwide. Would housing this franchise be more trouble than it was worth?<br/>
	<br/>
	But Jacob Will wasted no time in addressing the shortcomings of his baby. Immediately following the move, Jacob announced a massive re-brand for the organization. The Flying Pigs were dead. Enter the Angry Monkeys. Along with the physical re-brand came a mental one, as well. Gone were the days of being satisfied playing the role of also-ran spoiler. Divisions had arrived in the league, and suddenly the hill didn&rsquo;t seem so steep. The Monkeys didn&rsquo;t have to overtake six teams; they just had to outlast three of them.<br/>
	<br/>
	With a renewed vigor, Jacob overhauled his scouting department and adopted modern, outside-the-box strategies for drafting and acquiring players, as well as managing the roster throughout the season.<br/>
	<br/>
	The results were immediate and remarkable. It was as if The Flying Pigs franchise really <i>did</i> die, and a completely new, wholly separate franchise took its place.<br/>
	<div class="news-quote">We won&rsquo;t consider that debt paid until we&rsquo;re hoisting the Limousine on Elgin Avenue.<div class="author">Jacob</div></div>
	<br/>
	The Pigs, from 2007 to 2010, didn&rsquo;t have a single winning season. The Monkeys &mdash; showing nary a shadow of that <i>other</i> franchise, the one from Manhattan &mdash; haven&rsquo;t had a single <i>losing</i> season since 2011.<br/>
	<br/>
	And now, for the second straight year, they&rsquo;ve started out the season 3-0, with sights set much, much higher than a simple winning record. The Monkeys lead the West in points scored, so the undefeated mark can hardly be considered lucky. (In fact, the West Division standings are six tenths of a point away from being in perfect points order. Only IPP is out of line.) That high points position can be attributed for the most part to Matty Ice, Matt Ryan, who is currently the number two quarterback in the league.<br/>
	<br/>
	But he&rsquo;s not alone. DeMarco Murray is also second in the league in his respective position.<br/>
	<br/>
	Most recently, Matty Ice and Murray combined forces to put up 42.7 points together, which was every bit as much as they <i>needed</i> to put up, considering the Angry Monkeys got past historical division juggernaut Team Hauloll by the slimmest of margins, 100.9&ndash;99.7.<br/>
	<br/>
	A margin that wouldn&rsquo;t have held, had a two-point conversion try not slipped through Hauloll wideout Kelvin Benjamin&rsquo;s fingers. A shocked Jason Landoll didn&rsquo;t waste words explaining the inexplicable, after the game: &ldquo;That hurts. So many missed opportunities.&rdquo;<br/>
	<br/>
	Such is the life of a fantasy football owner. But one owner&rsquo;s misery is, of course, another owner&rsquo;s magical moment. And the magical moments are starting to come more frequently for the town of Tulsa, Oklahoma.<br/>
	<br/>
	&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t understand how happy I am for this city,&rdquo; Jacob said. &ldquo;The people have been so welcoming to our organization from day one, and we won&rsquo;t consider that debt paid until we&rsquo;re hoisting the Limousine on Elgin Avenue.&rdquo;<br/>
	<br/>
	The low growl of the Arkansas River continues uninterrupted. The shadows of the squat Ozark Mountains stretch across downtown Tulsa, and lights pop on intermittently in a little city winding down another day and preparing for the next.<br/>
	<br/>
	The next day in a little city, where big things just might be on the horizon.
