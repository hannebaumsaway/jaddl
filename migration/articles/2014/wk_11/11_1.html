	It&rsquo;s been well publicized &mdash; much to certain owners&rsquo; dismay (<i>cough&ndash;Lannie&ndash;cough</i>) &mdash; how poor the play in the West Division has been this season.<br/>
    <br/>
    This isn&rsquo;t going to help that perception.<br/>
    <br/>
    The Red Hornets lost this past weekend to IPA Connoisseur, 95.9&ndash;66.1 (<a href="http://football.fantasysports.yahoo.com/f1/430826/recap?week=11&mid1=2&mid2=12" target="_blank">game recap</a>). That loss dropped them to 3-8 on the year, and 3-5 in their division.<br/>
    <br/>
    It did not, however, drop the Hornets from playoff contention. You heard me. The 3-8 Red Hornets could still qualify for the postseason. For comparison&rsquo;s sake, Lawrence Football Jesus is 3-8 as well, over in the East. Jesus has scored 63 more points on the year than the Hornets have. Yet Jesus <i>has</i> been eliminated from the playoffs already.<br/>
    <br/>
    I doubt James, the father of the divisional format, will lament the imbalance, but others may. Two teams from the four-team clusterfuck in the East (the Bensons, Boom, the Shanks, and the Falcons) will be home for the holidays, possibly &mdash; maybe even probably &mdash; with superior point totals and records to some playoff contenders from the West.<br/>
    <br/>
    But that&rsquo;s how it goes.<br/>

    <br/>
    The Hornets do not, of course, control their own destiny. For their part, they must win out through the remainder of the season. That&rsquo;ll be hard enough by itself; the Hornets close out with two of the West&rsquo;s top three teams, the Tulsa Angry Monkeys and Riley County Comfort. Winning those two games would be a feat unto itself for the Hornets, but alone, it wouldn&rsquo;t be enough. They also need Riley County and Team Hauloll to lose out.<br/>
    <br/>
    That&rsquo;s where the <i>real</i> bad news is for the Hornets, as both Hauloll and Riley County get to play In Pursuit of Perfection, LLC, as one of their final two matchups. You remember In Pursuit of Perfection, LLC, don&rsquo;t you? That&rsquo;s the organization that walked away from a trade involving the Bad News Bensons&rsquo; Jamaal Charles, and proceeded to lose pretty much all its games since then en route to a 2-9 record. The odds that IPP is going to finish by doubling its win total are longer than my &hellip; well, they&rsquo;re long.<br/>
    <br/>
    But the Red Hornets can&rsquo;t worry about that now. And really, if you&rsquo;re 3-8, can you really justify worrying about the playoffs in general? Probably not.<br/>
    <br/>
    When the fact that his squad was still technically in contention was brought to Dan&rsquo;s attention Tuesday morning, the Hornets&rsquo; owner took it with a grain of salt. &ldquo;Madness. I think the last time that happened, with the Chiefs getting a similarly miraculous playoff berth, they got immediately smacked back to Kansas City.&rdquo;<br/>
    <br/>
    After a chuckle, though, Dan conceded, &ldquo;I like where your head is at.&rdquo;<br/>
    <br/>
    This is one of those awkward articles I have to write about a team after it loses a game, and for the Hornets to win their last two, they&rsquo;re going to have to get much, much better production from Matthew Stafford, and, uh, pretty much everyone else not named Eddie Lacy, who has turned up the dial the past month and a half. In the loss to IPA, Stafford put up 5.3 points. Not 15.3 &hellip; 5.3. The Hornets&rsquo; receiver corps combined for 7.2.<br/>
    <br/>
    Look, let&rsquo;s not make this complicated: the Hornets scored 66 points overall, and to do that, you have to have some guys putting up really shitty scores. And if the Hornets want to keep their postseason hopes alive, this has to be their last outing in the 60s for the rest of the year.<br/>
    <br/>
    There are voices around the league, though, quietly murmuring that they hope it isn&rsquo;t the last poor showing from the Hornets. There are some who believe a 5-8 team in the playoffs would be bad for the JADDL, bad for its perception as a top flight fantasy football league. But you know what? Dan doesn&rsquo;t give a shit about those voices.
