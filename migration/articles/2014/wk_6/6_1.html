	After starting the year with an absolute <i>thud</i>, the Millennium Falcons are once again evading Star Destroyers and wreaking havoc in the galaxy.<br/>
    <br/>
    The season could not have started much worse for the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy, when they set a new franchise low with 51.5 points in the opener against Legion of Boom. First round draft pick Demaryius Thomas face-planted out of the gate, as did third round pick Doug Martin. Only Jay Cutler and Percy Harvin got into double figures in the humiliating loss.<br/>
    <br/>
    Then things seemed to get worse. Martin and fourth round pick Jordan Cameron got hurt. The Falcons would have to try to rebound with Bobby Rainey taking RB2 snaps.<br/>
    <br/>
    And rebound they did.<br/>
    <br/>
    The following week, the Falcons shot up to 115.7 points when only two players <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> get into double figures (and one of those had 9.7) in a comfortable win over the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks. The season was reset at 1-1, and fans could forgive the Week 1 clusterfuck.<br/>

    <br/>
    Over the next three weeks, Millennium never dipped back below 100 on the scoreboard, even though that stretch included a loss in which the Falcons scored a season-high 121.6 &mdash; they just happened to be going up against Team Odouls, who saw their score and raised them 132.1. So the Falcons had to be content to enter interdivision play with a mediocre 3-2 record despite having the second highest point total in the East to that point.<br/>
    <br/>
    Thus, interdivision play would be crucial for the Space Birds. Would they come out on the other side mired in a contentious race for a playoff spot behind seemingly unstoppable Odouls, or would they be sitting pretty in a race for the Eastern Goblet while the other teams not named Odouls clawed for table scraps?<br/>
    <br/>
    This past weekend nudged them one step closer to the latter scenario when they survived a lackluster effort in an 88.7&nbsp;78.6 win over In Pursuit of Perfection, LLC. The Falcons got just 10.3 points combined from its two running backs, and Jeremy Maclin &mdash; whom Ian made the curious decision to start over Steve Smith Sr. &hellip; who happened to score 19 on the bench &mdash; only managed 1.6. Maclin, however, wasn&rsquo;t even the worst starting receiver on the day for Millennium. Percy Harvin actually took points <i>away</i> from the final score. Yes, that&rsquo;s right. He ended the day with -0.1. How that happened &hellip; well, you&rsquo;ll have to ask Pete Carrol about that.<br/>
    <br/>
    But Jay Cutler showed up with 22.3, Demaryius Thomas &mdash; seriously, what a stupid way to spell a name &mdash; added 18.4, and the Detroit Lions D/ST came up huge with 22 points of its own (are you shitting me?!), which turned out to be enough to get past floundering IPP.<br/>
    <br/>
    &ldquo;Any time you get negative points from a skill position player and still manage to win, you take it,&ldquo; said Ian. Asked to explain his decision to start Maclin over Smith Sr., he replied, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m partial to Mizzou guys. Just kidding. I don&rsquo;t know what the fuck I was thinking.&rdquo;<br/>
    <br/>
    It doesn&rsquo;t matter what he was thinking now, as the Falcons head into next week&rsquo;s match-up against the formidable Tulsa Angry Monkeys with a slight but significant two-game cushion over .500. Between Odouls and the Boom / Bensons / Longshanks heap is right where the Falcons want to be for now, while they hope Odouls at least stubs a toe in the near future.<br/>
    <br/>
    If they keep pace throughout interdivision play, they&rsquo;ll have earned it, as they have to go through the top two scorers in the West (the Monkeys and IPA Connoisseur) before heading back to the East.
