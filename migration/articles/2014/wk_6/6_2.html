	So often in sports, when a game is draped in high expectations and wild anticipation, it fails to deliver. See last year&rsquo;s Super Bowl, for instance (sorry Ian).<br/>
    <br/>
    That&rsquo;s why we should take the time to truly appreciate and applaud what we got to see this weekend. As the Chasm War got started, we were hashtag-blessed with an incredible match-up &hellip; on paper, at least. Undefeated Team Odouls against the 4-1 Angry Monkeys. Mm-mmm. Savory.<br/>
    <br/>
    But would it be, really? There was, of course, that nagging doubt in fans&rsquo; minds that the game would somehow clank and sputter to an unmemorable finish. When the 5-0 Falcons met 3-2 Team Hauloll in 2013, the teams combined for just 135.6 points total. When the 6-3 One Pump Chumps took on 7-2 Connoisseur in 2011, the victory margin for the Chumps was 41 points. When Odouls brought an undefeated mark (9-0) up against the 8-1 Longshanks in 2007, not only was the margin a wide 29 points, but the total combined score was a paltry 139.<br/>
    <br/>
    I could go on. The point is, we often set ourselves up for disappointment when we hype up a game.<br/>
    <br/>
    This time, the hype was justified.<br/>
    <br/>
    The game was tight throughout. After Thursday Night Football, the Monkeys made the most of opponent Andrew Luck&rsquo;s night by siphoning his points (and more) with T.Y. Hilton, and took a 3.7-point lead into Sunday. That was the last lead the Monkeys would have, though they refused to go quietly into the night. Early Sunday, Odouls pulled in front by 21 and held on to an 18-point advantage by Sunday&rsquo;s end. The 49ers&rsquo; D/ST gave it a go on Monday, but their 11 points fell short of what was required for the comeback.<br/>
    <br/>
    In the end, Odouls stayed perfect by defeating the Monkeys 128.9&ndash;121.2 in a wild game that saw both kickers score 16, both defenses separated by a single point, both flex players separated by <i>eight tenths</i> of a point, and the difference coming down to the ever-important quarterback position. Andrew Luck continued his blistering pace as the JADDL&rsquo;s leading QB by scoring 24.6. Matty Ice, on the other hand, had his second mundane game in a row with 14.7. After tantalizing Monkeys fans with 33.4 in the first week of the season, Mr. Ice has only scored over 20 twice since.<br/>
    <br/>
    That quarterback disparity was all the Near Beers needed to come away with the win of the season so far. The Monkeys will have to try to avoid a losing streak when they face the rising Millennium Falcons next week, another tough test and potential marquee game between two 4-2 squads. It won&rsquo;t have the cach&eacute; this game did, but maybe this is a sign of more exciting games to come, at least.<br/>
    <br/>
    Odouls will put its flawless record on the table against two teams which are currently .500 to wrap up interdivision play. Yahoo currently projects that perfection will elude them with a 12-1 finish (<a href="http://www.jaddl.com/index.php?view=scores&team1=5&yr=2007" target="_blank">sound familiar, Odouls fans?</a>). Then again, Yahoo originally projected Odouls would have a 5-8 season, so what the hell does Yahoo know?
