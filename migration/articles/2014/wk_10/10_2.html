	Alright, boys, let&rsquo;s get into this. With the way the standings have rounded out so far, there is no easy way to dissect the possibilities, so let&rsquo;s just pour some rubbing alcohol on the scalpel and start cutting.<br/>
	<br/>
	<div class="section-header">The West</div>
	We&rsquo;ll wade into the shallow end of the pool first. No, sensitive West owners, that wasn&rsquo;t a potshot at your division; it was a reference to the fact that your playoff scenarios are a little cleaner than that of your counterparts to the east. Settle down.<br/>
	<br/>
	In a nutshell, the Monkeys and Connoisseur would have to fuck up pretty monumentally to fall short at this point &hellip; that&rsquo;s particularly true for Tulsa. Both sit at 6-4, two wins ahead of fourth place Hauloll with three to play. The Monkeys also have a 5-2 division record, which only third place Comfort can match. If the Monkeys win one more, they&rsquo;ll finish ahead of Hauloll for certain, as Hauloll wouldn&rsquo;t be able to eclipse their records and is currently a billion (read: 194) points behind the Monkeys.<br/>
	<br/>
	That isn&rsquo;t to say the Monkeys have clinched, however. Hilariously, even the fucking <i>Red Hornets</i> could still trip them up. If the Monkeys lose out and the Hornets win out, the Hornets&rsquo; 6-7 record would be accompanied by a 6-4 division record, while the Monkeys&rsquo; division record would be an inferior 5-5. The Hornets winning out is a long shot, though, to say the least; they have to play the top three teams &mdash; the Monkeys, IPA, and Comfort &mdash; to wrap up the year. Still, IF they won out, they would hand a loss to IPA and the Comfort, the two of which could still end up 8-5 and 7-6, respectively &hellip; which would leave the Monkeys out in the cold, peering in through the window at the happy family gathered by the fireplace with cocoa and Chex mix.<br/>
	<br/>
	Sorry, I went a little too poem-y there. Back to the scenarios.<br/>
	<br/>
	You know who&rsquo;s in great shape? Riley County Comfort. They currently hold down that coveted third playoff spot at 5-5, with a stellar 5-2 division record, around 100 points more than Hauloll and the Hornets, and a schedule that cruises to the finish line with all three current non-playoff teams (Hauloll, Pursuit, and the Hornets).<br/>
	<br/>
	Frankly, it&rsquo;s easier to paint a picture in which IPA is kicked to the curb than Riley County. Riley also has a season sweep over IPA in its hip pocket, for good measure. With a win over Hauloll this weekend, they&rsquo;d have a sweep over them, as well. Basically, Riley <i>should</i> have been in the discussion for Jared&rsquo;s Goblet instead of the final playoff spot, but they fucked up by losing to lowly IPP before getting swept in the Chasm War. Beat IPP and win just one interdivision game, and we&rsquo;d be discussing 7-5, <i>division leading</i> Comfort. What could have been. I&rsquo;m sure Jesse will settle for a simple playoff berth, though, considering what most analysts thought of his team following the draft.<br/>
	<br/>
	Should one of the top dogs fall from grace, it&rsquo;ll be very interesting to see who between Hauloll and the Hornets rises up to take their place. Hauloll would be the obvious choice, as they&rsquo;re a game up overall on the &rsquo;Nets. However, should the Hornets put the pressure on by winning out &mdash; and we&rsquo;ve discussed how unlikely that is &mdash; Hauloll would have to exceed their effort and not only win out, but win out while scoring more points; they both have 3-4 division records, and the Hornets actually lead Hauloll in points to date.<br/>
	<br/>
	And IPP will spend its second consecutive season on the sidelines during the postseason. 5-8 wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get it done, I&rsquo;m sad to say.<br/>
	<br/>
	<div class="section-header">The East</div>
	OK, we&rsquo;ve put this off long enough. Once more into the breach, and all that jazz.<br/>
	<br/>
	Let&rsquo;s get this out of the way first: Team Odouls &mdash; your undefeated, league points leader Team Odouls &mdash; is in. Shit, they&rsquo;ve already secured the Eastern Goblet for goodness sake. They <i>will</i> be home for the playoffs &hellip; the first round, that is.<br/>
	<br/>
	So who will join them?<br/>
	<br/>
	Who the fuck knows.<br/>
	<br/>
	Even Football Jesus has yet to be eliminated (on a side note, if Darren Sproles could have mustered just eight more yards on Monday night, we&rsquo;d have a 4-6 Jesus and a <i>real</i> goddamn mess). There is a universe in which Legion of Boom and the Millennium Falcons both lose out and wind up 5-8. That would give the Longshanks one win (over the Falcons), and if they lost their other two, they&rsquo;d end up 6-7. Jesus would also be 6-7 with a winning spree to finish the season, and they&rsquo;d have a <i>better</i> division record (5-5) than the Shanks (3-7).<br/>
	<br/>
	You can read that again if you need to, but that universe &hellip; it exists. And in it, the Bensons and <i>Lawrence Football Jesus</i> would join Odouls in the postseason. And really, is it <i>that</i> far-fetched? The Falcons are already riding a three game losing streak as we speak, and Boom has the fewest points in the East &mdash; 54 points less than LFJ.<br/>
	<br/>
	The wrench in the spokes of that universe would probably be the Shanks, who are playing their best ball of the season and trail only mighty Odouls in points league-wide. Odds are they take at least two of three to close out, and if they only win one, Vegas would tell you it&rsquo;s going to be the one <i>against</i> Football Jesus. Then again, Vegas doesn&rsquo;t handicap the JADDL for a reason.<br/>
	<br/>
	For the Shanks&rsquo; part, that sweep against the West was really nice, but they&rsquo;d have been better served swapping some of those wins for ones against East teams, as their division record is a paltry 2-5. That means they can&rsquo;t win the tiebreaker against either Boom or the Falcons, both of whom have better division records while carrying identical overall records of 5-5. A tie with the Bad News Bensons would come down to either head-to-head, in which the Bensons would prevail (they beat the Shanks earlier this year), or, should the Shanks beat BNB in a couple weeks, total points, in which case the Shanks would certainly move on (they have 166 more points than the Bensons).<br/>
	<br/>
	With me so far?<br/>
	<br/>
	The Bensons are coming into this three-game melee with a one game advantage in overall records, so you have to think they&rsquo;ve got as good a chance as anyone to escape the scrum. Then again, they have Odouls and the Longshanks looming on the horizon, and their head-to-head scenarios don&rsquo;t enable any conclusions &mdash; they split with both East teams they&rsquo;ve played twice. Boom is on that horizon as well, and they have a better division record than the Bensons do.<br/>
	<br/>
	&hellip; Look, I think the only logical way to wrap our heads around this is with some hypotheticals.<br/>
	<br/>
	<b>SCENARIO: Bensons lose to Odouls, beat the Shanks, beat Boom.</b> The Bensons would be in at 8-5. Boom couldn&rsquo;t get to eight wins, and only one of the Falcons and Shanks could, because they play each other. In other words, in my best Captain Obvious voice, the Bensons control their own destiny, as you should have figured out by the fact that they&rsquo;re already a game up on the three 5-5 stooges. The point of this scenario was to let you know that the Bensons <i>still</i> control their own destiny even if they get plowed over by the U.S.S. Odouls this weekend.<br/>
	<br/>
	So which of the stooges (or Jesus!) will crawl through the shit and come out clean on the other side, with or without the Bensons? (Imagine Morgan Freeman delivering that line.)<br/>
	<br/>
	Here&rsquo;s the hilarious part: they <i>all</i> control their own destiny!<br/>
	<br/>
	&hellip; I think. Let&rsquo;s see.<br/>
	<br/>
	<b>SCENARIO: Boom wins out.</b> They&rsquo;d be 8-5 (duh). That would hand the Bensons a loss, dropping their ceiling to 8-5 as well, and as we mentioned, Boom would leap above BNB on account of division records. The story would be the same for the Falcons and Longshanks as well, if either one made it to 8-5 also (they couldn&rsquo;t both make it, as they play head-to-head): Boom would win the tiebreaker with its 7-3 division record, unbeatable by any other potential 8-5 team.<br/>
	<br/>
	<b>SCENARIO: Millennium wins out.</b> They&rsquo;d hand the Longshanks a loss on their way to 8-5, meaning 7-6 would be the best the Shanks could do at that point. The crucial game in this scenario would be Boom vs. the Bensons. If the Bensons won, Boom could no longer get to 8-5 of course, and the Falcons would be safely above them. If Boom won, both Boom <i>and</i> the Bensons could join the Falcons at 8-5 &hellip; so who would advance? The Falcons and Boom. Boom&rsquo;s division record would be 7-3, and the Falcons&rsquo; would be 6-4, while the Bensons&rsquo; would fall short at 5-5.<br/>
	<br/>
	<b>SCENARIO: The Shanks win out.</b> That would mean losses to both the Falcons and Bensons. The 8-5 Shanks would have the Falcons (with a best-case record of 7-6) in their rear-view, then, and the Bensons&rsquo; ceiling would fall to 8-5. If they did make it to 8-5, the Bensons would still, for all intents and purposes, be behind the Longshanks as well: they&rsquo;d have identical division records (5-5), a head-to-head series split, and the Shanks are way, way out in front in points. It wouldn&rsquo;t matter what Boom did in this case, because the Shanks would be guaranteed a top three spot, ahead of the Falcons and Bensons (and Jesus &hellip; let&rsquo;s not forget Jesus).<br/>
	<br/>
	Right, then. If you&rsquo;re in the middle of the swamp right now, and you aren&rsquo;t Jesus, just win, baby. Simple, see?!<br/>
	<br/>
	I think we can leave it at that. Those are the extreme cases, perhaps; it&rsquo;s probably more likely that none of the 5-5 teams win out, and we have a clusterfuck to sort through at the end of the season which is even more clustered and fucked than the quagmire I just waded through above. But it&rsquo;s late, and I&rsquo;m tired, and this is making my brain hurt.<br/>
	<br/>
	So, to you teams still in the hunt: good luck. Good hunting. And good night.
