	It was Monday night. There were a little over nine minutes left in the Panthers&ndash;Eagles game. And Team Hauloll was on its way to a humiliating loss at the hands of its rival, the Red Hornets, in the annual Duel in the Desert.<br/>
    <br/>
    Both JADDL squads had Panthers pass catchers active in Monday Night Football, and Greg Olsen was helping the Hornets pull slowly away from Hauloll as the night wound down. A 30-yard reception here. Another 17 yards there. And all the while, the clock <i>tick-tick-tick</i>s away.<br/>
    <br/>
    9:08.<br/>
    <br/>
    9:07.<br/>
    <br/>
    9:06.<br/>
    <br/>
    And then, <i>BAM!</i> Just like that, Kelvin Benjamin wrenched the spotlight away from Olsen and the Hornets, and stole the lead for Hauloll with a 21-yard touchdown catch from Cammy Cam Juice. A 4.5 point deficit became a 3.6 point lead in the blink of an unsuspecting eye.<br/>
    <br/>
    That would have been enough, as Olsen would be done for the night. But, for good measure, Benjamin added one more catch to his evening&rsquo;s tally &hellip; a catch that happened to go for 40 yards and another touchdown. Yes, Hauloll treated this rivalry game like, well, a rivalry game, and ran the score up on their Phoenix foes. An extremely tight battle will go in the record books as a 107.4&ndash;91.8 coasting by Hauloll.<br/>
    <br/>
    Jason assured reporters he knew what he was doing. &ldquo;Our intent was to bury the Hornets,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Running the score up wasn&rsquo;t the intent, it was the method. We struggled early on, and this season hasn&rsquo;t gone to plan, so when we finally got our foot on the Hornets&rsquo; throat, we pressed down.&rdquo;<br/>
    <br/>
    Was there a bit of released frustration in Hauloll&rsquo;s late score?<br/>
    <br/>
    &ldquo;Yeah, absolutely.&rdquo;<br/>

    <br/>
    Pundits can argue both sides on this one. Is fantasy football a gentleman&rsquo;s game that requires some level of restraint when an opponent is bested? Or is this a ruthless business that requires no-holds-barred tactics when applicable?<br/>
    <br/>
    Whatever the case may be, the fact is that there is no mercy rule in the JADDL. Points are points. A win is a win. There are no asterisks. There is no pity. And there will likely be no playoffs for the Red Hornets, who surprised everyone by even winning more than a game or two this season, let alone remaining in the postseason discussion through nine weeks.<br/>
    <br/>
    As for Hauloll, they&rsquo;re still on the outside looking in for now, and must set their sights on Riley County Comfort, who sit in front of them in the standings in the third and final playoff slot in the West. And wouldn&rsquo;t you know it: Hauloll and Comfort face off this coming weekend! God, the JADDL is so amazing like that. Comfort is a game up on Hauloll overall, but a full two games up in the division. If Hauloll wants to keep the dream alive, this is a must-win for them. Comfort is coming off two huge wins against the teams at the top of the division &mdash; IPA and the Monkeys &mdash; and closes out after this weekend with the bottom-feeders. So, again, that&rsquo;ll be a game Hauloll simply <i>has</i> to have.<br/>
    <br/>
    Tony Romo seemed up to speed after returning from his injury, which is helpful, since Hauloll doesn&rsquo;t have another quarterback on its roster. Shane Vereen will be back from his bye, which should help as well &mdash; assuming Jason remembers to start him this time.
