	Well. That was interesting. Interesting, but not unexpected.<br/>
    <br/>
    Another round of the Chasm War is finished, and with that, teams in the JADDL will revert to facing off against familiar division foes once again. This time around, however, there wasn&rsquo;t much of a war to be had.<br/>
    <br/>
    The East took bragging rights back home with them for the second straight year, winning 13 of the 18 games played over the past three weeks. The 13 wins were the most by either side in interdivision play since the league was split up. The 1,819.1 points scored collectively by the East teams were the most in Chasm War history, as well, shattering their own mark of 1,674.6 from a season ago.<br/>
    <br/>
    In other words, this was the most dominating Chasm War performance to date.<br/>

    The East was beasting from start to finish, earning winning records in each of the three weeks of play; 4-2, 5-1, 4-2. Team Odouls swept its West foes, keeping its undefeated record in mint condition for the home stretch. The Bad News Bensons and Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks were perfect in the War as well. No East squad went winless against the West, either, as Legion of Boom and Lawrence Football Jesus each went 1-2 for the division&rsquo;s worst results.<br/>
    <br/>
    And don&rsquo;t think for a second that interdivision play doesn&rsquo;t matter to the owners in the JADDL.<br/>
    <br/>
    From BNB headquarters, Alex tweeted, &ldquo;Hey boys, let&rsquo;s get this trending: #sweptthewest.&rdquo;<br/>
    <br/>
    Adam chimed in: &ldquo;#sweptthewest East > West&rdquo;. And Ryan did the same (&ldquo;IN! #sweptthewest&rdquo;). Before Week 8 had even concluded, Ryan also tossed out, &ldquo;I love playing West teams. Don&rsquo;t feel bad&rdquo; to Jason before the end to a merciless 110-point waxing of Team Hauloll by the Longshanks.<br/>
    <br/>
    For the West&rsquo;s part, IPA Connoisseur seemed to be the only team willing to put up any resistance to the East&rsquo;s blitzkrieg. IPA went through Boom, Jesus, and the Millennium Falcons unscathed, while Lannie&rsquo;s peers imploded with a collective 2-13 record. The Hornets, Riley County Comfort, and In Pursuit of Perfection, LLC, went winless in the War. The Angry Monkeys entered interdivision play an impressive 4-1, and now they leave it a vulnerable 5-3, tied with IPA atop the West.<br/>
    <br/>
    These were an embarrassing three weeks for teams on the left side of the map, and smugly satisfying for the teams on the right. The results were lopsided enough, in fact, for the East to overtake the West in all-time interdivision wins. The overall Chasm War record now stands at 46-43-1 in favor of the East. We&rsquo;ll see if the trend continues in 2015.<br/>
    <br/>
    As for this year, Alex summed up the situation nicely &hellip;<br/>
    <br/>
    &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t call it a Chasm War if they don&rsquo;t fight back.&rdquo;
