	Let&rsquo;s be brutally honest, here. When you&rsquo;re 1-6, you don&rsquo;t have much to play for. Occasionally you get to shoot for the moon and spoil someone else&rsquo;s season. But when you&rsquo;re playing a team which is 2-5 itself, what can you spoil for them? Nothing.<br/>
    <br/>
    That leaves pride as the only thing left for which to lace up the imaginary cleats. Luckily, the Chasm War is all about pride. Pride in your squad. Pride in your division&rsquo;s superiority over the other.<br/>
    <br/>
    That sense of pride is what ultimately carried the day for Lawrence Football Jesus in their 107.5&ndash;97.7 victory over the Red Hornets this weekend. Pride, and the New Orleans Saints combo of Drew Brees and Mark Ingram. Fellow Saint Jimmy Graham finally contributed, as well.<br/>
    <br/>
    The Jesus victory ensured another winning week for the East over the West &mdash; four wins, two losses &mdash; in a season full of nothing <i>but</i> winning weeks for the East over the West. More on that later.<br/>
    <br/>
    The picture was grim for LFJ early on. Wide receiver Brian Quick got caught up in the Chiefs&rsquo; slaughter of the Rams and scored just a single point before exiting with a season-ending shoulder injury. James &hellip; was <a href="https://twitter.com/LFootballJesus/status/526432111746895872" target="_blank">less than optimistic</a>: &ldquo;Folks, I&rsquo;m pretty sure this weekend is going down as the all-time lowest point in the history of the Lawrence Football Jesus franchise.&rdquo;<br/>
    <div class="news-quote">I WAS GOING TO LOSE TO DAN AND BE 1-6.<div class="author">James</div></div>
    <br/>
    On the other sideline, the Hornets got big games from Matthew Stafford and Golden Tate in their early-early game across the pond in London. When the first round of games was in the books, Football Jesus trailed by 43.<br/>
    <br/>
    That was certainly the low point of the weekend for LFJ, but by no means was it the low point in franchise history. Jesus would not be forsaken this time, as it happened. Sunday Night Football brought forth a holy gift: the three Saints, which combined for 62.4 points and brought Jesus into a dead heat with the Hornets. Going into Monday night, the two squads were locked up around 93 points apiece. The battle would come down to a head-to-head brawl between speedy Blood &mdash; or was it Crip? &mdash; DeSean Jackson for LFJ and Pierre Gar&ccedil;on for the &rsquo;Nets.<br/>
    <br/>
    And that battle would hinge on the marginal right arm of one Colt McCoy, the kid who never survived an entire game against Kansas State when he was at Texas. He&rsquo;d have to survive this night, because, well, who the fuck is the Redskins&rsquo; fourth-string quarterback? Is Jason Campbell still in the league? (It turns out the &rsquo;Skins don&rsquo;t have a fourth QB, not even on the practice squad. So we&rsquo;d be looking at a triumphant Kirk Cousins return, and we all know how that would work out.)<br/>
    <br/>
    In the end, the mano a mano duel didn&rsquo;t leave us on the edge of our seats for long. By halftime, Jackson had 6.7 points on 67 yards, while Gar&ccedil;on was going backward with -0.2. At the final whistle, Jackson had secured the win for Jesus with 13.6, over Gar&ccedil;on&rsquo;s 4.7.<br/>
    <br/>
    Despite other players having higher point totals, James tagged Jackson as his player of the game when asked. &ldquo;He sealed the deal.&rdquo;<br/>
    <br/>
    When asked to clarify his early comments about this being a possible low point for the LFJ franchise, James responded via text (really): &ldquo;I literally couldn&rsquo;t field 2 RBs. I WAS GOING TO LOSE TO DAN AND BE 1-6.&rdquo;<br/>
    <br/>
    He&rsquo;s right about the running backs, by the way. With Bernard Pierce a healthy scratch (read: he sucks) and Darren Sproles still an unhealthy scratch, James fielded a questionable Trent Richardson, who didn&rsquo;t do anything &mdash; no, seriously, he scored zero-point-zero.<br/>
    <br/>
    And if we&rsquo;re talking about low points in LFJ history, c&rsquo;mon; we&rsquo;d be remiss if we didn&rsquo;t bring up the <i>actual</i> low point for the franchise. That would be a <a href="http://games.espn.go.com/ffl/boxscorequick?leagueId=244721&teamId=6&scoringPeriodId=10&seasonId=2007&view=scoringperiod&version=quick" target="_blank">29-point outing way back in 2007</a>. If you&rsquo;re looking for a low point, that game had it all: two players with negative points (the Saints D/ST and freaking Philip Rivers &hellip; how often do you get negative production from your QB?!); two players with zero (Vernon Davis and Devin Hester); only one player in double figures (get this: <i>Warrick Dunn</i>); and the major feature in this horror show is that the victorious opponent was none other than John Miller&rsquo;s Upset Underdogs! What a memory. Sorry, James.<br/>
    <br/>
    But that&rsquo;s the point: this game in no way resembled <i>that</i> game. This game saw Jesus celebrating with most of its Eastern brethren. This game saw a triple digit score. This game wasn&rsquo;t a 40-day fast in the wilderness.<br/>
    <br/>
    This game was water into wine.
