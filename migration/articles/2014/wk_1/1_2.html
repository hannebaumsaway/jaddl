	Because some things deserve mentioning, but don&rsquo;t deserve their own feature articles, I do things like this.<br/>
    <ul><br/>
    	<li>This year, because I guess the other stuff I do doesn&rsquo;t take up enough of my time, I&rsquo;ve decided to add a new stat for us to track: which team is getting the most from a given position through the current point in the season? Obviously, these won&rsquo;t be that exciting after just one week, but maybe it&rsquo;ll give us something to talk about as the season progresses.<br/>
        <br/>
        Also, the Flex position make it kind of weird, but I just go strictly by how you guys have your lineups set each week. &ldquo;RB&rdquo; only includes the two RB spots, and so forth. &ldquo;Flex&rdquo; is just the guy in the Flex spot, regardless of his actual position (RB/WR/TE). This is just for fun, anyway, so SHUT UP.<br/>
        <br/>
        For now, the kings of each position are as follows:<br/>
        <br/>
        <b>QB:</b> Monkeys <i>(Welcome back, Matty Ice.)</i><br/>
        <b>RB:</b> Shanks <i>(If this is Le&rsquo;Veon stoned, keep that chronic blazing.)</i><br/>
        <b>WR:</b> Shanks <i>(When Megatron is beasting, worlds end.)</i><br/>
        <b>TE:</b> Pursuit <i>(Peyton gets thirsty for Orange Julius in the red zone.)</i><br/>
        <b>Flex:</b> Boom <i>(C. Patterson is so good he makes Matt Cassel look decent.)</i><br/>
        <b>D/ST:</b> Monkeys <i>(Aging schmaging. San Fran made Tony Romo look like Tony Romo.)</i><br/>
        <b>K:</b> Bensons <i>(A kicker going off is fine. A kicker leading you in scoring is not.)</i></li><br/>
        <li>The West has struck first blood in the divisional points race, outscoring the East by 10 in Week 1. If the East needs someone to blame, look to a certain spaceship which made the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs. If you don&rsquo;t get that reference, you aren&rsquo;t nerdy enough.</li><br/>
        <li>The Player of the Week was the Angry Monkeys&rsquo; Matt Ryan, with 33.4 points. That&rsquo;s more than Matty Ice scored at any point in 2013. Having Roddy and Julio back doesn&rsquo;t suck for Mr. Ryan. Or Jacob.</li><br/>
        <li>Is anyone else having a little trouble getting used to points extending out to the hundredths place now?</li><br/>
        <li>Speaking of Yahoo things, color me disappointed in Yahoo&rsquo;s live scoring module, or &ldquo;StatTracker&rdquo; as they call it. It gets the job done, but man, is it <i>ugly.</i> Also, it doesn&rsquo;t tell you what JADDL team a player is on when he makes a play &mdash; or I couldn&rsquo;t find that information, if it does.</li><br/>
        <li>But for as disappointed as I am in the StatTracker, I&rsquo;m even more thrilled at the league site overall. Yahoo&rsquo;s wealth of information, views, and options is far beyond anything we had with ESPN. And the site is (ironically, considering the last bullet point) much, much more aesthetically pleasing as well. If Yahoo improves its live scoring and gives us flexibility with the I.R. slot, we&rsquo;ll be in serious business.</li><br/>
        <li>Free agent bidding may end up being the best thing that&rsquo;s happened to this league since divisions. And we haven&rsquo;t even really seen the bidding get crazy yet. CAN&rsquo;T WAIT.</li><br/>
        <li>Maybe I don&rsquo;t fully understand America&rsquo;s legal system &mdash; perhaps the JADDL&rsquo;s official counsel, James, could weigh in? &mdash; but shouldn&rsquo;t the conversation surrounding Ray Rice be about why he isn&rsquo;t currently in <i>jail</i>, not if he should or shouldn&rsquo;t be in the NFL?<br/>
        <br/>
        Michael Vick went to prison for, what, over a year? For dog fighting. And Rice has virtually no legal repercussions for sucker-punching a woman?</li><br/>
        <li>When are some of you guys going to contribute articles to the newsletter? It&rsquo;s time. Some of our best works have been user-submitted. Like <a href="index.php?view=news&yr=2011&wk=4&pg=3" target="_blank">this</a>. And <a href="index.php?view=news&yr=2011&wk=6&pg=3" target="_blank">this</a>. Get on it.</li><br/>
        <li>Speaking of user-submitted, if you aren&rsquo;t reading every damn thing <a href="http://jaddl.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">The DDL</a> puts out, you should be. You <i>really</i> should be.</li>
