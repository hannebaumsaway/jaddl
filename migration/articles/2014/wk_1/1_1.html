	2010 was a long time ago. Back in 2010, Haiti was rocked by that earthquake. BP was dumping oil into our beautiful ocean. Thirty-three Chileans got trapped in a mine. WikiLeaks was suddenly something that existed. Remember the Ground Zero mosque shitstorm? That was in 2010.<br/>
    <br/>
    Remember Team Odouls&rsquo; last Briefly Badass? That was in 2010, too.<br/>
    <br/>
    At least it <i>was</i>, until this weekend. Now Odouls&rsquo; last Briefly Badass was in 2014, thanks to its 118.0 &ndash; 77.3 win over the Bad News Bensons. That 118 narrowly edged out the 115.9 put up by the Tulsa Angry Monkeys to give Odouls the top mark for Week 1 of this fresh season.<br/>
    <br/>
    When it won the B.B. back in Week 11 of 2010, Odouls was led by Aaron Rodgers (okay), Santonio Holmes (heh), and Thomas Jones &mdash; you remember Thomas Jones, don&rsquo;t you? He played running back for the Chiefs!<br/>
    <div class="news-quote">We&rsquo;re on top of the East right now, and we intend to stay there.<div class="author">Adam</div></div>
    <br/>
    This time around, Odouls was led by Andrew Luck and his 28.7 points. It took Luck a half to get going at Mile High, but once he did, he couldn&rsquo;t be stopped. That&rsquo;s a relief for a team whose back-up quarterback is &hellip; wait, Odouls doesn&rsquo;t <i>have</i> a back-up quarterback currently on its roster.<br/>
    <br/>
    What Odouls does have, however, is a stout-looking running back corps. Matt Forte and Rashad Jennings scored 16.9 and 15.6, respectively, though Jennings didn&rsquo;t really do jack shit until the fourth quarter of the Lions&rsquo; blowout of the Giants. So we&rsquo;ll see how stout that RB corps looks in a few weeks.<br/>
    <br/>
    But for now, Odouls overall was stout enough to start the year 1-0 for just the third time in its JADDL history. &ldquo;Starting off with a win is huge,&rdquo; said Adam. &ldquo;When we&rsquo;ve started out 1-0 in the past, we&rsquo;ve had a lot of success. We&rsquo;re on top of the East right now, and we intend to stay there.&rdquo;<br/>
    <br/>
    Actually, Odouls has had quite a bit of success whether they&rsquo;ve started 1-0 or 0-1. It&rsquo;s one of the most successful franchises no one talks about, because a) they have yet to win a Jared Bowl, and b) they haven&rsquo;t made the playoffs since the league was split into divisions. What they have done, on the other hand, is avoid bottoming out, hitting those sea-level lows that seem to affect so many other franchises &mdash; even the ones with championship pedigree. The Hornets and Longshanks followed up their Jared Bowls with extended stretches of incompetence. The Chumps (now Riley County Comfort) went 2-11 a year ago. Even Boom had that forgettable 3-9-1 campaign.<br/>
    <br/>
    But Odouls has never won fewer than five games in a season. In fact, they&rsquo;ve been consistent to a <i>fault</i> recently, winning exactly five games in three of the past four seasons. 5-8 isn&rsquo;t really the end goal for any franchise, after all. But Odouls remains tied for third in career wins, third in career points, and fourth in career points per game average. This is no slouch we&rsquo;re talking about here.<br/>
    <br/>
    There is that empty space on the Odouls mantle where a Limo would go, though, and until that&rsquo;s taken care of, the Near-Beers may continue to go unheeded and unappreciated by its peers.<br/>
    <br/>
    &ldquo;Soon,&rdquo; says Adam, &ldquo;soon.&rdquo;
