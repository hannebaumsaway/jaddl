	The Bad News Bensons <i>needed</i> this one.<br/>
    <br/>
    With their backs against the wall, the Bensons came out swinging against Lawrence Football Jesus and came away with a 117.8&ndash;87.4 victory to get off the snide and move to 1-3. 1-3 certainly isn&rsquo;t where you want to be &hellip; unless your alternative is 0-4. And with that, another #0and13Watch is put to bed.<br/>
    <br/>
    The Bensons also moved closer to securing a reputation as The Franchise of Misfit Quarterbacks. If you&rsquo;ll recall, BNB made use of Terrelle Pryor a year ago to scratch out an improbable win. This year, the baton was passed to Teddy Bridgewater, whom the Bensons picked up in free agency on September 24th. Now, Bridgewater&rsquo;s participation wasn&rsquo;t the difference between a win and a loss for the boys in the muted blue and mocha &mdash; Cam Newton scored ten points less on the bench, which would still have resulted in a 20-point Bensons win &mdash; but it speaks more to the flexibility the Bensons can wield going forward, as they try to claw their way back into the East Division race.<br/>

    <br/>
    Bridgewater was impressive in his rookie debut. 317 passing yards and a rushing touchdown chalked up 23.4 points for the Bensons, and he out-dueled both his NFL QB counterpart, Matt Ryan, and his JADDL one, Drew Brees.<br/>
    <br/>
    And what a race it could be. Two teams sit alongside Bad News at 1-3: Football Jesus and the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks. Team Odouls is threatening to run away and hide with the Eastern Goblet at this point, having posted another win and another monster point total. The defending champs, The Mighty Boom, are a complete bullshit 3-1, and no one expects them to keep winning when scoring around 80 points a game (last in the division). The Bensons&rsquo; arch-nemesis, the Millennium Falcons, are a more intriguing topic of evaluation. They&rsquo;re 2-2, but have scored 110 or greater in three of their four games (I rounded 109.5 up, sue me). That includes a loss this weekend in which they scored 121.6.<br/>
    <br/>
    This all adds up to a potentially wild ride on the right side of the map as we go deeper and deeper into the season.<br/>
    <br/>
    It also adds up to 1-3 teams like the Bad News Bensons reasonably continuing to hope and plod and crawl and grind toward a playoff berth. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see a problem, now that we got this win,&rdquo; said Alex via text from Kauffman Stadium on Tuesday night. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been in this spot before, mired in this shit, and we&rsquo;ve come up smelling like roses.&rdquo;<br/>
    <br/>
    Indeed they have. In fact, the Bensons started 1-3 a year ago, before going on to win eight of their last nine games &mdash; and the division. They&rsquo;ve started 0-4 just once in franchise history, to kick off that dreadful 2009 campaign (Return of Ron Mexico &mdash; ha! &mdash; finished 2-11 that year).<br/>
    <br/>
    In this weekend&rsquo;s win that enabled Bad News to avoid 0-4, the real story was The Return of Jamaal Charles. Charles, who put up 29 points, looked every bit like his old, shifty, spark plug self; every bit like a number two overall pick <i>should</i> look, and then some. If J.C. continues at even half that pace, the Bensons will look like a very, very different team than the lackluster unit that took the field in the first three weeks of play.<br/>
    <br/>
    Teddy Bridgewater may just be along for the ride.
