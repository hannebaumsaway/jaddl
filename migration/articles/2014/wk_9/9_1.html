	Legion of Boom. Will. Not. Go. Away.<br/>
    <br/>
    We all know about the illustrious history of the Boom franchise. Tops in career points. Tops in points per game. Tops in win percentage. Tops in wins.<br/>
    <br/>
    Tops.<br/>
    <br/>
    But this year is different. Well, check that: this year <i>should</i> be different. Boom is currently at the <i>bottom</i> of the East Division in points scored. That&rsquo;s right; even behind their Lawrence cohabitant, Football Jesus. (Of course, the bottom of the East this season would equate to the very middle of the West, ahead of three teams and behind three others.)  Boom had games of less than 80 points four times in 2012 and 2013 combined &hellip; they&rsquo;ve scored under 80 four times <i>this season</i> already, with four weeks still left to play in the regular season.<br/>
    <br/>
    This uninspired output wasn&rsquo;t altogether unexpected, either. Jake Gutierrez handed Peter a D for his drafting efforts &mdash; an action that alone was enough to elicit gasps from the JADDL community &mdash; and Yahoo projected Boom would go 4-9.<br/>
    <br/>
    <i>Poppycock</i>, fans across the league thought. <i>The Boom front office knows what it&rsquo;s doing.</i><br/>
    <br/>
    Apparently, the Boom front office knows how to set up a schedule. They&rsquo;ve been scored on the least of any team in the entire league. They&rsquo;re the only team in the East with a points-against value down in the 700s. They&rsquo;ve had opponents score in the 50s &mdash; the <i>fifties!</i> &mdash; three fucking times this season. That&rsquo;s only happened two other times in the modern (divisions) era in the JADDL, and not since 2010. In the first two weeks of the season, Boom&rsquo;s two opponents <i>combined</i> scored 105.4.<br/>
    <br/>
    I can&rsquo;t use enough italics to illustrate how absurd this is, folks.<br/>
    <br/>
    Yet none of the above changes one simple fact: Legion of Boom is 5-4. They&rsquo;re in second place in the East, as they have a better division record (4-2) than their 5-4 counterparts, the Millennium Falcons (3-3) and the Bad News Bensons (2-4). They also own the head-to-head edge on both, with one matchup remaining with the Bensons, while both games against the Falcons are in the books after this weekend&rsquo;s 120.0&ndash;95.4 victory in the unofficial rivalry known as the &ldquo;Star Wars Nerd-Off.&rdquo;<br/>
    <br/>
    This, by the way, was the first game in 2014 in which Boom scored over a hundred. Since that dreadful season in 2007, the least amount of games Boom has scored in triple figures in a given season is six. Five, of course, would be their max this season.<br/>
    <div class="news-quote">Russell is my guy, and will continue to be my guy until the day he&rsquo;s no longer my guy, at which point Ben will be my guy.<div class="author">Peter</div></div>
    <br/>
    Boom is getting it done through active roster manipulation. Denard Robinson, acquired off waivers on October 22nd, presents a unique opportunity, as he&rsquo;s classified as both a running back and wide receiver, giving Peter a great amount of roster flexibility. Robinson filled a running back slot against the Falcons and provided Boom with 16.4 points.<br/>
    <br/>
    There is some heartburn associated with such active management, though. Like trading for Russell Wilson and playing him over a quarterback you drafted, Ben Roethlisberger, a week after Roethlisberger scored 47 points &hellip; only to have him throw away 40 <i>more</i> points on your bench this week. It&rsquo;s safe to say there&rsquo;s a quarterback controversy in Lawrence these days.<br/>
    <br/>
    &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no quarterback controversy,&rdquo; says Peter. &ldquo;Russell is my guy, and will continue to be my guy until the day he&rsquo;s no longer my guy, at which point Ben will be my guy. I don&rsquo;t see anything controversial about that.&rdquo;<br/>
    <br/>
    Whoever the guy is, Pete will probably have to pick the <i>right</i> guy from here out. There aren&rsquo;t any easy games in the East this year, and Boom isn&rsquo;t likely to get 30 points from Jeremy Hill in another game.<br/>
    <br/>
    Then again, maybe their opponents will resume putting up 50 points a game, and Legion can just cruise into the postseason on that charmed unicorn of theirs.
