    Oh man. This is gonna be good.<br/>
    <br/>
    <a href="index.php?view=news&yr=2014&wk=preseason&pg=2" target="_blank">As we discussed before</a>, the move to Yahoo uncovered a feature we should all appreciate and enjoy: Rivalry Week.<br/>
    <br/>
    You all have rivals. Now you get to solidify your hatred for them by facing off in Week 10 every single season. You don&rsquo;t even have to wait for the new schedule to be released each summer; you can go ahead and circle the weekend on which Week 10 of the NFL slate falls, and start the countdown to bragging rights.<br/>
    <br/>
    Here is a quick preview of the 2014 edition of the rivalry games.<br/>
    <br/>

    <b>Bad News Bensons v. Millennium Falcons.</b> <i>Because, you know, Alex and Ian are related.</i> This game, simply put, is massive. The playoff implications cannot be overstated. Both teams are part of the 5-4 bottleneck in the East. The winner of this one will be at least a game up on dreaded fourth place in the division, and with just three games left to go after this weekend, every win is amplified.<br/>
    <br/>
    BNB will have to go to war with their backup QB, Ryan Tannehill. That&rsquo;s the bad news. The good news? Tannehill scored 28 points a week ago, while starter Philip Rivers scored, uh, -2. A Rivers bye couldn&rsquo;t have come at a better time. That means Antonio Gates is on a bye as well, though, so Owen Daniels will likely get the nod at tight end.<br/>
    <br/>
    The Falcons will be without the services of Alfred Morris, which hurts, as Morris has been on a tear the last two weeks. Can a team starting Boobie &mdash; yes, <i>Boobie</i> &mdash; Dixon and James Starks at running back really secure a dubya in such an important game? We&rsquo;ll see.<br/>

    <b>Legion of Boom v. Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks.</b> <i>Because Pete and Ryan became friends in Prague, and Prague had the Velvet Revolution.</i> Like The Family Feud, this game has playoff ramifications written all over it. The Longshanks lag behind the 5-4 trio by a game, and a win head-to-head over one of those 5-4 teams would be double the pleasure. A loss might start the bells tolling on the Shanks&rsquo; season.<br/>
    <br/>
    The All-Whites will welcome back Aaron Rodgers, Calvin Johnson, and Roddy White from bye weeks just in time for this rivalry game. And their return is necessary, as Cammy Cam sucks, Lamar Miller and Emmanuel Sanders are banged up, and the shine was scraped off Chris Ivory in Kansas City last week.<br/>
    <br/>
    We&rsquo;ll see if Boom will finally pull the trigger on Ben Roethlisberger, and whether that proves to be a good move if he does. Aside from that roster decision, Boom enters this week void of any bye week impacts. Now would be an opportune time for LeSean McCoy to act like the number one pick, and Alshon Jeffery should be firing on all cylinders once again after getting a week off.<br/>

    <b>Lawrence Football Jesus v. Team Odouls.</b> <i>Because <a href="index.php?view=news&yr=2013&wk=5&pg=2" target="_blank">read here</a>.</i> You look at the records for these two teams, and you think to yourself, &ldquo;This should be a laugher.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t be so sure about that, though. First of all, if you bothered to read that link a few seconds ago, you&rsquo;d know that odd, weird, crazy, insane, fucking bizarre shit happens in Jesus-Odouls games.<br/>
    <br/>
    Also, it just so happens that Jesus is playing decent imaginary ball right now. Since the start of interdivision play, Jesus has scored the fifth most points in the league; third most in the East. Drew Brees is doing Drew Brees things, Mark Ingram is suddenly the Alabama version of Mark Ingram, and waiver wire pick-ups Markus Wheaton and Martavis Bryant have been major players the past two weeks. That being said, they&rsquo;ll <i>need</i> to be major players again this week, as wide receiver staples DeSean Jackson and DeAndre Hopkins are on byes. Trent Richardson is, too, but he blows anyway.<br/>
    <br/>
    And Odouls &hellip; I mean, Odouls is Odouls. The team keeping <i>#13and0Watch</i> alive deep into the season (again). HOWEVER, they aren&rsquo;t invincible, as seven-plus years without an undefeated champ tells us, and now they have to go into an emotional rivalry game without the services of QB rockstar Andrew Luck and how-the-fuck-is-this-guy-good Julian Edelman. An emotional rivalry game, in which odd, weird, crazy, insane, fucking bizarre shit happens on an annual basis.<br/>
    <br/>
    So Steven Hauschka is going to channel his inner Seabass and score 47 points from the kicker position for LFJ, and Odouls will counter with Alex Smith throwing six TDs, also known as &ldquo;the Roethlisberger Special.&rdquo;<br/>

    <b>Tulsa Angry Monkeys v. Riley County Comfort.</b> <i>Because both Jacob and Jesse lived in Manhattan after college at one time or another.</i> The West features but a single rivalry game with significant, direct playoff implications, and this is it. The Monkeys are trying to hold on for dear life to the top spot in the division, while Riley County is trying to hold on for dear life to a playoff spot in general. RCC is trying to stave off the Red Hornets down the stretch. You heard me: the Red Hornets are suddenly, inexplicably, in the playoff hunt. But more on that later.<br/>
    <br/>
    We don&rsquo;t know yet if Tulsa has fully recovered from the Chasm War beatdown they suffered in weeks 6 through 8, but after last week&rsquo;s win over Team Hauloll, the fact remains that the Monkeys have lost to just one West team so far this year. That team, naturally, was Riley County Comfort. Comfort took the first meeting between the two in Week 5 by a 15-point margin in a well played game. The Monkeys will be without the services of Andrew Luck&rsquo;s favorite target, T.Y. Hilton (the T.Y. stands for &ldquo;<i>thank you</i> very much, Andrew Luck&rdquo;), and it&rsquo;ll be interesting to see if the fantasy football gods punish them with bad juju for quickly snatching up the disgraced Adrian Peterson from the trash heap when he became available.<br/>
    <br/>
    Comfort is getting hit <i>hard</i> by the bye bug this week. Seriously, go check out his bench. Six of the seven players on there are on byes. That group includes the suddenly rejuvenated Tom Brady, Dwayne Allen, Keenan Allen, and Andre Johnson. That means the Riley County banner will be rushed onto the field in the hands of Colin Kaepernick, Eric Decker, and Terrance Williams.<br/>

    <b>Team Hauloll v. Red Hornets.</b> <i>Because they live in Arizona. Duh.</i> Like I said before, the Red Hornets suddenly find themselves in the mix for postseason play. In fact, the Hornets are actually <i>above</i> Hauloll in the standings, due to a superior division record. I could make a crack about how that just shows you how bad the West is this year, but I won&rsquo;t. Even though I just did. Both Hauloll and the Hornets are 3-6, meaning the winner inches closer to .500 and a seat at the table, while the loser leaps toward almost certain extinction for the remainder of 2014.<br/>
    <br/>
    Hauloll has one giant question mark coming into this game: will Tony Romo be healthy? If not, the start at QB will fall to <span style="text-decoration:underline;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> . In other words, Hauloll is rocking a &ldquo;Questionable&rdquo; QB without another QB on the roster right now.<br/>
    <br/>
    The Hornets won&rsquo;t have Pierre Gar&ccedil;on, who has been a disappointment lately anyway. Can Mohamed Sanu and Golden Tate keep their stellar play going? They&rsquo;ll need to, for the Hornets to pull this one out. Matt Stafford has been a roller-coaster, though his latest turn has been upward at least. Over the last four weeks, the Hornets have actually been better than Hauloll, so who should be considered the favorite in this one? Yahoo says Hauloll still (60%).<br/>

    <b>IPA Connoisseur v. In Pursuit of Perfection, LLC.</b> <i>Because Lannie and Nomac both live in Wichita. This isn&rsquo;t rocket science.</i> It&rsquo;s quickly becoming a forgettable year for IPP, LLC. They&rsquo;re 2-7, third from the bottom in the league in points scored, and things are only getting worse; since the start of interdivision play, they&rsquo;re <i>last</i> in points scored league wide, averaging just 72 points per game in that span. Yuck. IPA, meanwhile, still have dreams of Jared&rsquo;s Goblet floating in their heads. They&rsquo;re only a game back of the Monkeys technically, though the gap is really two games for all intents and purposes, considering the difference in division records between the two teams.<br/>
    <br/>
    If IPA does want a shot at that Goblet, in any event, this is a game they simply cannot drop. They hammered Pursuit by 36 earlier in the year with big time performances from Arian Foster, Randall Cobb, and the New England defense. Foster and New England are on byes, so the baton will pass to Justin Forsett &mdash; the 275-dollar man &mdash; and a defense to be named later. A big game from Peyton Manning wouldn&rsquo;t hurt, either.<br/>
    <br/>
    As for Pursuit, well, they&rsquo;re rolling out there with the likes of Dwayne Bowe and Juwan Thompson (who?), so you can see why Yahoo considers them about a 3-to-1 underdog even with IPA having an empty D/ST slot currently. But hey, Danny Woodhead is avail &hellip; wait, no, he&rsquo;s on a bye. Too bad. I wonder if flashbacks to <i>The Trade That Wasn&rsquo;t</i> with the Bensons keep Nomac awake at night &hellip;<br/>
