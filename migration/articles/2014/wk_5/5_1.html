	Flash back to seven weeks ago. The draft had just concluded, and the owners in the East War Room were poring over the results, offering up instant analysis of each team&rsquo;s roster. When Riley County Comfort&rsquo;s team was pulled up, there was a general air of dismissal and derision around the room. Comments like, &ldquo;What was he thinking?&rdquo;, &ldquo;They might go oh and thirteen,&rdquo; and &ldquo;He picked Tom Brady <i>there?</i>&rdquo; were tossed out, and then the group moved on to another team down the line.<br/>
    <br/>
    A short while later, Jake Gutierrez weighed in with his professional opinion, and it was more of the same. Guti gave Jesse a D- for his efforts, citing the overall age of the roster as a primary concern.<br/>
    <br/>
    Jesse wasn&rsquo;t fazed, though. Ever the optimist, he said he was &ldquo;stoked&rdquo; about his team when he addressed the media, and when asked which pick he most regretted after having time to reflect on the draft, he said he &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t really have one.&rdquo; The media, fans, and, in all likelihood, Jesse&rsquo;s peers just shook their heads quietly and waited for the shit to hit the fan.<br/>

    Week 1 produced a loss for Comfort, as expected, but the score still managed to raise some eyebrows around the country. RCC had managed to put up 94 points in the loss, more than many pundits thought they were capable of scoring in any week, let alone the first week. But Week 1 would barely register as a shock compared to what would happen the following game.<br/>
    <br/>
    Up against the West&rsquo;s most powerful franchise, Team Hauloll, Riley County came away with a victory, putting an end to the speculation of a winless season in just two short weeks. Hauloll limped to a meager 59.4 score, sure, but RCC wasn&rsquo;t about to rely on a weak outing from its opponent, eclipsing its surprising Week 1 tally with 100.1. Pundits would have put money on RCC not scoring triple digits all year. Now they had done so, beaten mighty Hauloll, and evened their record to 1-1. What the hell was happening?<br/>
    <br/>
    Another win in Week 3 over IPA Connoisseur shielded criticism from a mediocre point total (82.1), but the criticism came in Week 4, when Comfort finally looked like the lackluster squad everyone expected at the beginning of the year. Comfort lost to In Pursuit of Perfection and only managed 63 points, while falling back to .500 and allowing the rest of the division to relax a little bit about the prospects of the easy win on the schedule they&rsquo;d all anticipated and banked on.<br/>
    <br/>
    Riley County had had a nice little run, but the magic had worn off, and they&rsquo;d stumble back into the abyss, forgotten by year&rsquo;s end. Right? Plus, to ensure and perhaps speed up that descent into darkness sat the Tulsa Angry Monkeys, undefeated and the undisputed class of the West through the first third of the season.<br/>
    <br/>
    Yet, once again, Comfort refused to follow the script.<br/>
    <br/>
    The Monkeys didn&rsquo;t make it easy for them, and it certainly didn&rsquo;t appear as though they <i>overlooked</i> Riley County, but Comfort prevailed nonetheless. Behind a stellar one-two Monday Night Football punch of Russell Wilson and Marshawn Lynch, RCC scored a 108.6&ndash;93.1 knockout against the Monkeys (<a href="http://football.fantasysports.yahoo.com/f1/430826/recap?week=5&mid1=10&mid2=9" target="_blank">game recap</a>), ending their undefeated hopes and keeping Riley County&rsquo;s playoff hopes very much alive.<br/>
    <br/>
    Comfort also got double-digit production from Steven Jackson and Frank Gore, two set of those &ldquo;old balls&rdquo; Jake Gutierrez was lamenting.<br/>
    <br/>
    &ldquo;I think my entire neighborhood knows how pumped I am about the Wilson-to-Lynch TD that just happened!&rdquo; said Jesse on Monday night via Twitter.<br/>
    <br/>
    The comeback was large and impressive, but not wholly unexpected by Jacob. Before the weekend&rsquo;s conclusion, Jacob confessed that he wasn&rsquo;t confident his lead would hold up. &ldquo;My thirty-six-point cushion doesn&rsquo;t look so large when RCC still has the entire Seahawks offense.&rdquo; And he was right to worry, of course. Wilson had a field day (34.2) against the hapless Washington [team nickname redacted], while Lynch enjoyed significant success of his own (17.7). The 34-point performance by Wilson was his career high, surpassing the 29 he put up in Week 13 a year ago when he was wearing the green and white of Team Hauloll. And it was more than enough this night.<br/>
    <br/>
    Now Riley County enters inter-division play with a winning record &mdash; good for second place in the West &mdash; and all the momentum and excitement in the world. And oh-by-the-way, let&rsquo;s not forget that this franchise won two games <i>all of last year,</i> when they were still the One Pump Chumps. Could we see another re-brand success story in the making? The Monkeys did it when they ditched the Pigs and the pink.<br/>
    <br/>
    Why not Riley County?
