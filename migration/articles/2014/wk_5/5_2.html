	Inter-division play is here, and boy, is it getting off on the right foot.<br/>
    <br/>
    The marquee match-up of Week 6 is undoubtedly the Tulsa Angry Monkeys facing off against Team Odouls. That&rsquo;s right. We get to start the inter-division slate with a game between the top teams in each respective division. It doesn&rsquo;t get any better than this, folks.<br/>
    <br/>
    We were one game away from getting to call this a clash between two unbeatens, but <a href="http://www.jaddl.com/index.php?view=news&yr=2014&wk=5&pg=1" target="_blank">Riley County ruined that</a>, of course. So, as it is, the Monkeys will be trying to rebound, and rebound in a hurry. Coming off a loss after four straight wins is, quite literally, uncharted territory for Jacob.<br/>
    <div class="news-quote">&hellip;as epic as a battle can be between two teams that have zero championships between them.</div>
    <br/>
    Adam, on the other hand, does have experience holding on to an unblemished record for an extensive chunk of the season. In 2007, if you recall, Odouls made it all the way to the final week of the regular season before suffering its first loss &hellip; to the Red Hornets, who would then go on to beat them <i>again</i> three weeks later in Jared Bowl I. Yep: Odouls only lost to one franchise all year, and only came away with the bittersweet Surrendered Keys to show for it. No undefeated season. No Court-Ordered Limousine.<br/>
    <br/>
    So, obviously, they&rsquo;re hoping this year is different. Back in 2007, Odouls managed to stay undefeated after a Week 7 tilt against a 5-1 team (the One Pump Chumps, in case you care) and again in Week 10 against an 8-1 squad (the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks), so rising to the occasion won&rsquo;t be anything new to an Odouls team looking to stay perfect.<br/>
    <br/>
    The numbers would seem to favor Odouls, as well. They&rsquo;ve scored 12.6 points more per game than the Monkeys with a much greater degree of consistency. Odouls has only dipped below 100 once, and that was still a respectable 91.4. The Monkeys have a 70.1 mark on their record &hellip; a game they still won. That 91-point outing by Odouls did come this past week, however, so if there&rsquo;s anything to be said for momentum, now might be a good time to play them.<br/>
    <br/>
    But because we&rsquo;re the JADDL, we don&rsquo;t stop at surface impressions. We go deeper. Let&rsquo;s look at how the individual player match-ups shake out to see who really has the advantage going into this epic battle &mdash; or as epic as a battle can be between two teams that have zero championships between them.<br/>
    <br/>
    Yahoo gives Odouls the edge with a 57% win probability and a projected 105.9 points to the Monkeys&rsquo; 98.6 projection. Neither team has any players on byes, which is pretty remarkable this time of year. However, if there is a cue-ominous-music sign for Odouls, it is the Rashad Jennings injury. Jennings has been solid, and without him, the Near Beers have to turn to rookie Bishop Sankey. In Week 4, Sankey gave fans a glimmer of hope that he&rsquo;d live up to his breakout hype coming into the season, but Week 5 threw a wet blanket on that hope.<br/>
    <br/>
    Andrew Luck is matched up against the Texans, which is neither a particularly good nor particularly bad thing. Luck seems to be match-up proof for the most part anyhow. Jordy Nelson has an unfavorable opponent in Miami, but Antonio Brown and Matt Forte could have huge weeks against Cleveland and Atlanta, respectively. Hotlanta? More like Hot-Mess-lanta.<br/>
    <br/>
    The Monkeys have to expect more from A.J. Green than what they got a week ago. Sure, he ended up with 12 points, but he was shut down for much of the evening by a desperate Patriots team. The Monkeys will need every last point they can get from Green, because star running back DeMarco Murray might have an off night himself this coming week, when he&rsquo;s matched up against the Legion of Boom &hellip; as in, the Seattle defense, not the JADDL franchise. Seattle has given up the fewest points to opposing running backs so far this season.<br/>
    <br/>
    The other dynamic to watch for in this one is who Odouls&rsquo; Luck is throwing the pigskin to. Adam may pump his fist if he sees a Luck touchdown, but if that touchdown pass is caught by T.Y. Hilton of the Angry Monkeys, that fist pump may turn to a slap on the forehead.<br/>
    <br/>
    The Monkeys&rsquo; Matt Ryan could be poised for another big week himself. He gets to go home after a pretty mundane effort in New York, and face off against a Chicago squad that just got diced up by Aaron Rodgers a couple weeks ago, and didn&rsquo;t fare a ton better against Cammy Cam and the Panthers last week.<br/>
    <br/>
    A lot of potential points are out there for these two teams to grab, regardless of how the match-ups work themselves out. You think Odouls fans are rejuvenated now? Wait &rsquo;til they win this game. Houston will be as amped as it&rsquo;s been since Hakeem Olajuwon rattled rims down there. And Monkeys fans can completely wash out the bad taste in their mouths after losing their own bid at perfection with a win this weekend.<br/>
    <br/>
    The inter-division table is set, and the spread looks de-lish indeed.
