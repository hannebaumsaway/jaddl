	The grades are back! The world famous Jake Gutierrez has once again blessed us with his wisdom by analyzing the 2014 JADDL Draft. Since we last spoke to Jake, he&rsquo;s added &ldquo;beloved TV personality&rdquo; to his resume, as his radio program, <i>The Border Patrol</i>, now airs on 38 The Spot on weekday mornings in the Kansas City metro area. Jake still jet-sets around the country crunching numbers and keeping NFL broadcasts running smoothly for CBS, as well.<br/>
    <br/>
    And despite that insane schedule, Jake still carved out time to grade our draft. I&rsquo;d like to say that speaks to the prestigiousness of the JADDL, but it really speaks to Jake&rsquo;s generosity and love of fantasy football.<br/>
    <br/>
    But enough of that! The bell is tolling &hellip; time to see if you get an extra recess for acing your homework, or if you have to visit the principal&rsquo;s office after school.<br/>
    <br/>
    (In the order in which the teams drafted.)<br/>
    <br/>

	With the Chiefs O-line looking awful, with its poor play and suspensions, McCoy was the no-brainer at #1 overall. I&rsquo;m not huge on Andre Ellington, but a lot of experts like him. It&rsquo;s not a huge reach &mdash; his average draft spot is 3.02 &mdash; but two RBs I like better in Doug Martin and Zac Stacy went shortly after. I like this WR corps, headlined by one of the best in Alshon Jeffery. Floyd and Patterson are solid, but there&rsquo;s not much depth after that. I think Jeffery is poised to have a monster year. You reached on your QB, getting Kaep at the end of the 6th. It&rsquo;s tough drafting on either end because you never know what&rsquo;s coming back, so sometimes you have to reach; but when you took Kaepernick, every other team already had their 1st QB. You were the last to draft your QB, so odds were you could have gotten him at 8.12. Plus, I would have gone with Foles if you were going to reach. I do like some of your fliers on RBs late &mdash; like Hill and Brown &mdash; but I might have taken a shot at a WR instead of going with RB on 6 of your last 7 picks. Also, no kicker was taken. That&rsquo;s not a huge deal, but I would make sure you snag one off the wire as soon as it opens. You have a couple of studs, but your lack of depth at WR and your reach at QB concerns me.<br/>

    The first thing that stands out to me when I took a deep look at this squad is solid depth at the WR spot. I love Keenan Allen and think Torrey Smith is going to thrive in Gary Kubiak&rsquo;s offense for the Ravens. Roddy White is a great 3rd WR, and I think by the end of the season Cooks could be Brees&rsquo; #1. Green at the TE spot was solid for getting him in the 12th round. I just wonder how much Gates has in the tank, because that will dictate how much he sees red zone targets. The second thing I noticed was the clear lack of a legit #2 RB. You did get the handcuff for Charles &mdash; and trust me, I think you&rsquo;re going to need Knile this year, with the Chiefs&rsquo; O-line. Buffalo&rsquo;s RB spot is a mess with Spiller and Bryce Brown muddying up the waters there for Jackson. Lamar Miller is most likely going to split carries, but with Knowshon coming into camp fat, who knows what&rsquo;s going to happen with the Dolphins&rsquo; backfield. Cam Newton is a top 8 guy at QB, but your back-up Johnny Clipboard was a huge reach in the 10th round considering he&rsquo;s not going to start. I am a fan of Cincy&rsquo;s D, but again, kickers and DSTs don&rsquo;t do a whole lot for me. I usually play the match-ups every week with players off the wire at those positions.<br/>
    <br/>
    <div class="section-header">Team Hauloll | <b>C+</b></div><br/>
    Big question here: how much does AP/AD have left in the tank? At #3 you had to take him. I still think he is going to be a top tier RB this season. Love Stacy and Bell for your 2nd and 3rd RBs. I think Grimes could be a sneaky good pick, being that Foster has an injury history. Love Julio Jones but your #2 WR is just OK. I think by the end of the year Justin Hunter is going to be the man for the Titans. Ertz went right around where he should have, and I think anyone in the Philly offense is good to have, since Chip Kelly runs 15-20 more plays than other teams. I do like Hopkins and think he will probably be starting over Wright for you by the end of the year. Reggie &ldquo;Old Balls&rdquo; Wayne is intriguing to me. Coming off that injury, you don&rsquo;t know what you are going to get from him, but I think he is worth a flier. You have a lot of young dudes like Benjamin and Andre Williams that could be boom-or-bust guys. Cam doesn&rsquo;t have many weapons at all in Carolina, so if Benjamin can stay healthy he might get a lot of targets. I am worried about your QB spot. You reached for Romo about one round too early and you don&rsquo;t have a back-up. This concerns me.<br/>

    I love Luck. I have him ranked in the top 5 QBs, and to get him in the 6th is a steal to me. Even with Pass TDs only being 4 points, I still think he is going to be a fantasy stud. Jordy will see a ton of targets up in Green Bay and Antonio Brown is the main man in Pitt. I like both of those guys. Forte and Jennings are a nice 1-2 punch, and Sankey is a big boom-or-bust guy &mdash; but he should get a good chance to be the man. We know McCluster isn&rsquo;t a large carry guy and Shonn Greene might vulture some TDs away, but Sankey could be a good #3 RB. You took some good fliers on some back-ups that could see some carries at RB in Hyde and Michael if the #1 in SF or SEA go down. I REALLY like Denver&rsquo;s DST &hellip; God I really hate saying that. That just bruised my soul.<br/>

    If you listen to the <i>Border Patrol</i>, you probably know about my man-crush on Nick Foles. For you to have Cutler and Foles is fantastic &mdash; although it might cause you some issues on who to go with, and sometimes that can be a tough call. Better to have 2 studs at QB then zero, so I like what you did here. D. Thomas is Peyton&rsquo;s #1 target, and with Welker hitting the clubs on Molly, this could favor him even a little more in the first 4-6 weeks. I&rsquo;m a big fan of Doug Martin &mdash; especially in the 3rd Round. His average draft position is 2.07 so you got great value. Jordan Cameron is one of my favorites at the TE spot this season. With no Josh Gordon he is easily the #1 option for Hoyer in CLE. We saw what Harvin did in the Super Bowl and how electric he can be if he can avoid migraines and stay on the field. One of my biggest sleepers this year is Rueben Randle, so I love that pick. You do need to look for a new kicker because Prater is out the first four weeks. STL DST is stacked on the D-line, so this squad will see lots of sacks. MJD could bounce back, and knowing that RUN DMC can&rsquo;t ever stay healthy I think he will be the man in OAK. Overall this is very balanced team with good depth at all spots. Plus, I love the team name &hellip; combined with the Foles pick you might have moved yourself from a B+ to A-.<br/>

    Of course any team with &ldquo;The Forehead&rdquo; under center for them has a huge advantage. That&rsquo;s not why I like this team though. I think Arian Foster &mdash; if healthy &mdash; will return to form as one of the top RBs in the league. I love Cobb and think he will be the most productive WR for Green Bay. Not a fan of Spiller; I think he&rsquo;ll struggle in the Bills&rsquo; new offense. I am a big Crabtree fan and LOVE Ben Tate, so I think that pick will make up for Spiller. Tate is one of my sleepers this season. If Jordan Reed can stay healthy it shouldn&rsquo;t matter who is playing QB for WASH: he will be productive. Not a fan at all of the Ray Rice pick. He is a player on the decline and will miss the first two games. I understand that is really good value in the 7th Round, but I&rsquo;m still not big on him. You probably should drop Gordon if you haven&rsquo;t already. (That secondhand smoke will get you every time.) Josh McCown could turn into a nice bye week fill-in and have some trade value by the end of the year. I do worry about Marvin Jones&rsquo; health; he will probably miss the first month of the season &mdash; but with your WR depth he might be a nice surprise once he returns to the lineup. I like Mike Evans quite a bit, and he and Cooks will be the best two rookie WRs.<br/>
    <br/>
    <div class="section-header">Red Hornets | <b>B-</b></div><br/>
    The name of this team should be &ldquo;Old Balls.&rdquo; This would have been an amazing draft &hellip; five years ago. Fitz, CJ2K, Carson Palmer, Greg Olson, Phil Dawson; that&rsquo;s a hell of a lineup in 2009. Kidding aside, I do like the young running backs; Lacy way more than Ball, and Johnson is a decent 3rd. I LOVE the Justin Hunter pick. I think he may end up being a top 15 WR. I know he is going to pad his stats Week 1 against Ron Parker and company. Stafford is a stud, but has the tendency to throw too many INTs. The Golden Tate combo might pay off nicely. I also think that Greg Olson could break out with the lack of talent at the WR spot for Carolina.<br/>
    <br/>
    <div class="section-header">Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks | <b>A</b><img src="assets/images/trophies/trophy-hoodie.png" /></div><br/>
    This might be the team I would pick to play with in this league. How can you not like Megatron? He is the best WR in the league, with a better nickname than anyone. I love Rodgers: the clear choice as the #2 in my mind, behind the Forehead Donkey. I think Bell is poised to have a monster year and most people shied away from him just because of a little weed. A &ldquo;steal&rdquo; in the 3rd Round &hellip; see what I did there? Rivers is a great back-up if Rodgers goes down again, and Gronk is Gronk, baby. He will get back to his spiking form quickly. The only flaw with this squad is the 2nd RB. Thomas and Ivory are both in a split backfield, and I&rsquo;m not sure what to make of Bradshaw because Trent Richardson sucks big ones. Ebron and Matthews could be solid back-ups. I wish the Chiefs had drafted Matthews. I think he will quickly pass the racist in Philly as the #2 guy for Foles. And, for whatever it&rsquo;s worth, the Longshanks have the best kicker. Oh yeah, I almost forgot Sanders is going to be a huge snag the first 4-6 weeks because Welker loves his Molly and tossing out Benjamins at the Kentucky Derby. The WR depth is awesome on this squad. Should be able to flip some of that to upgrade the 2nd RB.<br/>
    <br/>
    <div class="section-header">Riley County Comfort | <b>D-</b></div><br/>
    OK, I change my mind, Red Hornets: <i>this</i> is the team that should really be called &ldquo;Old Balls.&rdquo; I get taking Lynch at 1.09, but to follow that with Gore in the 4th, Jackson in the 7th, and Run DMC in the 9th? No thanks! I still like Brady, but he&rsquo;s not the fantasy stud he has been in the past. I think he will have a nice bounce-back year with a healthy Gronk though. Not a Decker fan at all &hellip; Geno was the worst starting QB in the league last year and Deck was a product of Manning&rsquo;s offense. The Law Firm is in a crowded backfield and the Bungles love the rookie Hill, who will see most of the 2nd carries behind Bernard. Umm, do you not watch the Preseason? I would have stayed far away from the Chiefs D. I know they should get a lot of sacks, but I have a bad feeling they are going to get torched through the air. The only saving grace for that pick is that Dave Toub is the best special teams coach in the league, and De&rsquo;Anthony looks like a bad MF&rsquo;er. Sorry, but I am not impressed with this squad.<br/>
    <br/>
    <div class="section-header">Lawrence Football Jesus | <b>C-</b></div><br/>
    I love the Brees/Graham double up / catch up combo. Obviously this draft was before Welker went Mandy (what they call Molly in the UK) style to the Derby. That hurts this team A LOT! I like D-Jack and think he should be a dynamite duo with Gar&ccedil;on in Washington. The New England backfield is always impossible to figure out with The Hoodie, so I never love Pats RBs, but you did cover yourself by getting the two faves; so that was somewhat of a smart move. If you didn&rsquo;t read my comments for the Longshanks, then let me repeat my feelings for Trent Richardson: he sucks. I liked Tavon Austin a lot more before Bradford went down. That&rsquo;s obvious but not sure what to make of the situation now. I would like this a lot more if he was your 3rd WR like you planned, but you are going to have to start him &mdash; and that I don&rsquo;t like. Might want to seek out another back-up QB; I don&rsquo;t think Bridgewater is going to see much time until later in the season. This is a tough grade because Welker really screwed you like a sorority girl on MDMA.<br/>
    <br/>
    <div class="section-header">Tulsa Angry Monkeys | <b>B</b></div><br/>
    This is a pretty even team. I like the balance. AJ and TY are a nice 1-2 punch for your WR slot. Not a huge Wallace guy, but someone has to catch the ball in South Beach. The ageless wonder Anquan Boldin is a nice bye week option. Witten is Romo&rsquo;s security blanket, so he is going to get plenty of targets &mdash; and even if he doesn&rsquo;t hold up all season, I think Walker is a decent back-up. Ryan and Dalton are solid. You will have some tough calls going with the match-ups with those two. Your last two picks are trash and probably the first two guys you cut for free agents off the wire. Murray, Gerhart and Bush are solid 3 RBs. I really like Murray; he just needs to stay on the field. San Fran&rsquo;s D will be interesting to watch. They have been one of the best, but age and the salary cap might catch up to them this year.<br/>
    <br/>
    <div class="section-header">In Pursuit of Perfection, LLC | <b>B-</b></div><br/>
    First off, you drafted Mr. Glass &hellip; and backed him up with EJ Manuel? BAD MOVE! At the very least you should have taken Cousins. Manuel sucks, and RG3 will be hurt by Week 6. You have solid WRs; Dez and Cruz should be pretty good, and after Bowe sits out Week 1 for his late night Sonic run, he should be a good bye week guy and maybe even flex option if he can repeat the playoff effort he had last year. Even though Watkins was the first rookie WR drafted, he&rsquo;s not my favorite rookie. Part of it has to do with his bone-headed coach playing him in the team&rsquo;s 5th preseason game with banged up ribs &hellip; only to injure them more in that game. Way to go, Doug Marrone, you MORON. Not a fan of the double DST picks. You&rsquo;re probably going to have to drop one anyway to pick up a kicker, so why not just draft a kicker? Bernard should be a stud, and Mathews always worries me because the dude is never healthy, so good move to get the Head of Wood. Not sure what to think of Robinson except he&rsquo;s a 3rd RB for a bad offense. DeAngelo is a decent pick for a flier, but that is a crowded backfield. Tolbert and Stewart always seem to snag D-Will&rsquo;s goal line carries. The TE spot is solid with Orange Julius and Eifert. This team has some potential, but with the RG3/Manuel and double DST moves, it leaves me scratching my head.
