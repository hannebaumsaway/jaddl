	I&rsquo;m going to be completely honest with you: I don&rsquo;t even know what to put in this article.<br/>
    <br/>
    In fact, I call upon ALEX BENSON to write this article for me, in the form of a DDL blog post.<br/>
    <br/>
    Why? Because In Pursuit of Perfection, LLC&rsquo;s season was truly and wholly defined by <i>The Trade That Wasn&rsquo;t,</i> and I don&rsquo;t have the full facts and complete story like Alex does.<br/>

    I know IPP would have come away with Jamaal Charles, who ended up averaging 15.5 points per game. The hilarious part about the would-be trade, as I understand it, is that the sticking point &mdash; the crux of why the whole thing fell apart at the eleventh hour &mdash; was Danny Woodhead.<br/>
    <br/>
    Danny fucking Woodhead!<br/>
    <br/>
    Amazing.<br/>
    <br/>
    The trade discussion also involved Kirk Cousins off the waiver wire, who, in retrospect, didn&rsquo;t do jack shit, and is now on the bench &hellip; not behind RG III, mind you, but behind Colt McCoy.<br/>
    <br/>
    Colt fucking McCoy!<br/>
    <br/>
    Amazing.<br/>
    <br/>
    So yes, though I&rsquo;ve used &ldquo;amazing&rdquo; twice in this write-up, IPP&rsquo;s season was anything but. They finished 2-11 in the putrid JADDL West and scored the least amount of total points in the league. Their roster was whatever the opposite of a &ldquo;who&rsquo;s who&rdquo; is (but it still includes Danny Woodhead!). Giovani Bernard was pretty decent, then got hurt. Dez Bryant was the sixth best receiver in the league, which is nice &hellip; but as a second-rounder, he finished behind seventh-rounders Emmannuel Sanders and Jeremy Maclin. Julius Thomas did pretty much what he was supposed to do, ending up as the #3 tight end in the league behind Gronk and Graham.<br/>
    <br/>
    I mean, I&rsquo;m trying, folks. I&rsquo;m reaching for material here. But again, once Nolan turned down that massive trade, his season was over. And that was like Week 2 or 3. Which is why IPP finished the year with nine straight losses. (Coincidentally, the Bad News Bensons finished the year 8-1 over that same stretch.)<br/>
    <br/>
    And that&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve got. Alex, I leave the details of The Trade That Wasn&rsquo;t to you, my friend.
