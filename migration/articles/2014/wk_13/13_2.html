	One could argue, if they were so inclined, that the 13-week regular season is just an appetizer to what comes next. A massive appetizer, to be sure &mdash; like a Bloomin&rsquo; Onion, or loaded nachos &mdash; but an appetizer nonetheless.<br/>
    <br/>
    That appetizer is now just a sad looking plate with crumbs scattered on its surface, and the main course has finally arrived.<br/>
    <br/>
    The playoffs.<br/>
    <br/>
    This is the cutthroat world we live for, where every win is a direct step up the ladder to glory, and the next loss will be your last. Every yard in every game is crucial. A dropped pass can be the difference between the Limousine and the Surrendered Keys, or no hardware at all. Your running back just fumbled in garbage time of his NFL game, and you lost by a point? Tough titties, take a seat.<br/>
    <br/>
    But why am I telling you this? You know what the playoffs are. Let&rsquo;s take a look at the participants, and see which of them may be poised for a run at greatness (as if we can predict this shit with any sort of regularity).<br/>
    <br/>
    <div class="section-header">IPA Connoisseur</div>
    Any discussion about the Connoisseur starts with Peyton Manning, who has been surprisingly human several times this season, including last weekend against the Chiefs. Luckily for Lannie, Peyton gets to play in sunny San Diego in the semifinals, as opposed to frigid Kansas City. Still, he&rsquo;s scored under 20 twice in his last three games, which has to be a concern for IPA. He did score 31 the last time he was on the west coast, though.<br/>
    <br/>
    Arian Foster has been a pleasant surprise after getting hurt &mdash; again &mdash; in Week 3. Since his partial return in Week 4, he averaged 25.2 points per game &hellip; until he got hurt &mdash; again &mdash; in Week 9. He returned &mdash; again &mdash; last week, though, and looked in shape as he scored 16.5. Lannie hopes he can hold together for just three more weeks.<br/>
    <br/>
    <span class="highlighter">Why the Connoisseur might sniff the good stuff:</span> The emergence of Justin Forsett. Remember when everyone <a href="http://jaddl.tumblr.com/post/97154382987/market-watch-week-1-justin-forsett-fever" target="_blank">gave Lannie a bunch of shit</a> for spending $275 on Forsett in the first week of waiver bidding? Yeah, well, Forsett may just be the key to IPA finally driving home the Limo. He averaged 22 points in his final three games of the regular season, and if he keeps that up, he and Foster will be a nasty one-two running back punch.<br/>
    <br/>
    <span class="highlighter">Why they might wrinkle their noses in disgust:</span> The receiver position is tenuous. Mike Evans exploded in weeks 9 through 11, making IPA fans giddy; but Week 13 reminded us that he&rsquo;s dependent on Josh McCown for his production when he scored just 4.9 points. To make matters shakier, Randall Cobb has slowed in Jordy Nelson&rsquo;s great white wake, averaging a pedestrian 9.8 in his last four games.<br/>
    <br/>
    <div class="section-header">Tulsa Angry Monkeys</div>
    The story out of Tulsatown is that of a weak second half of the season. Since inter-division play, the Monkeys scored the fourth fewest points the league &mdash; and the lowest of any playoff team. After a hot start, &ldquo;Matty Ice&rdquo; Ryan became a hot mess, and because of it, Jacob had to turn to another Ryan: Ryan &ldquo;I played receiver in college&rdquo; Tannehill.<br/>
    <br/>
    The Monkeys also picked up Ray Rice, which might bring some bad mojo down on their heads. They were once 4-0 &hellip; now they&rsquo;re 8-5. You do the math.<br/>
    <br/>
    <span class="highlighter">Why the Monkeys might tally me banana:</span> DeMarco Murray stayed healthy this season, and he ain&rsquo;t fuckin&rsquo; around. Far and away the best running back in the JADDL, Murray has favorable matchups in two of the next three weeks.<br/>
    <br/>
    <span class="highlighter">Why they might get caged:</span> I already told you they have Tannehill. Well, they&rsquo;re actually double-Dolphining with Mike Wallace, who has scored in double figures just once in his past six games. Yuck. T.Y. Hilton has been erratic as all hell this season; extremely so of late, going 2-22-12 in his last three. To bolster this sketchy WR corps, the Monkeys are filling the flex with &hellip; Malcolm Floyd, who is a slightly worse version of Mike Wallace.<br/>
    <br/>
    <div class="section-header">Riley County Comfort</div>
    No one thought we&rsquo;d be talking about RCC this time of year, did they? Not after they got a D&ndash; draft grade from Jake Gutierrez and generally mocked across the JADDL landscape for drafting a great team with which to compete in 2008. But here they sit, regardless, after winning four of their final five games. They also get to dance with the Monkeys in the quarters, a team they swept in the regular season, and against whom they averaged 115 points.<br/>
    <br/>
    <span class="highlighter">Why Riley County might comfortably cruise:</span> Tom Brady. Turns out that reanimated corpse can still toss the pigskin around. Bill Belichick is going to tire of playing running back roulette, and focus once again on letting his golden goose drop eggs all over people&rsquo;s faces. Gronk is Gronk once again, and Brandon LaFell has come on strong of late. Brady has eclipsed the 25-point mark three times since Week 5.<br/>
    <br/>
    <span class="highlighter">Why they might be comfortably on their couch in a week:</span> Their receivers are fucking terrible. (Damn, does <i>anyone</i> in the West have a good receiving corps?!) Keenan Allen has failed to score even five points on five separate occasions, and Andre Johnson&rsquo;s corpse is far less animated than Tom Brady&rsquo;s at this point in his career.<br/>
    <br/>
    <div class="section-header">Team Odouls</div>
    So 13-0 didn&rsquo;t quite happen, but Odouls fans shouldn&rsquo;t fret: they&rsquo;re still in great shape. They did set the record for scoring in a single season, after all. They only scored under a hundred twice all year &mdash; both against that kissed-by-an-angel dynasty, Legion of Boom. Will the prowess of the regular season campaign translate into Odouls&rsquo; first Court-Ordered Limousine, or will it wither into a third set of Surrendered Keys (or nothing at all)?<br/>
    <br/>
    <span class="highlighter">Why Odouls might have a moment of clarity:</span> Forget the TCU Horned Frogs; Team Odouls runs the true &ldquo;Air Raid&rdquo; offense. Andrew Luck is the #1 QB in the league, and he&rsquo;s figuratively throwing the ball to Antonio Brown and Jordy Nelson, respectively the #1 and #3 receivers in the league. When they all three bring their A-games, which they very often do, Odouls is very, very tough to beat.<br/>
    <br/>
    <span class="highlighter">Why they might fall off the wagon:</span> As trivial as this may sound &mdash; and when you&rsquo;re discussing weaknesses of an 11-2 team, you often sound trivial &mdash; Odouls&rsquo; tight end and flex spots are iffy. Kyle Rudolph is currently occupying the starting TE slot, and he&rsquo;s yet to score over 10 this entire season. As for the flex, it&rsquo;s been primarily Julian Edelman, who is the epitome of boom-or-bust. Since Week 9, he&rsquo;s been much closer to the <i>bust</i> end of the spectrum.<br/>
    <br/>
    <div class="section-header">Bad News Bensons</div>
    Once upon a time, the Bad News Bensons were 0-3. No team in JADDL history had started 0-3 and made the playoffs; and there were 13 teams which started 0-3 prior to this season. Well, nine wins and one loss later, and the Bensons are heading into those unreachable playoffs with a laudable 9-4 record.<br/>
    <br/>
    <span class="highlighter">Why the Bensons might have good news:</span> C.J. Anderson. Since acquiring Anderson in a trade with Team Odouls before Week 11, Anderson has given the Bensons 21 points per game on average. That doesn&rsquo;t look to slow down as the Broncos continue to pound the rock following their embarrassing loss to St. Louis in which they ran the ball just 10 times.<br/>
    <br/>
    <span class="highlighter">Why they might have bad news, indeed:</span> When Philip Rivers is bad, he can be <i>really</i> bad. As in, <i>negative points</i> bad (see Week 9). He was really good to close out the season in Week 13, with 27 points, but in his three games prior to that, he averaged 7.7 points. Not 17 &hellip; seven. Alex better pray the <i>good</i> Philip comes to play throughout December.<br/>
    <br/>
    <div class="section-header">Legion of Boom</div>
    Ah, the magical unicorn ride continues. Sometimes, when you&rsquo;ve been winning as long as Pete has, you can&rsquo;t lose no matter what you do. Not even when you score fewer points on the season than Lawrence Football Jesus. Not even when you lose two of three to West teams. Not even when you score under 80 four times, and over 100 just twice. Boom said fuck it, we&rsquo;re going to the playoffs anyway! Haters gonna hate.<br/>
    <br/>
    <span class="highlighter">Why Boom might just repeat:</span> The number one overall pick in the draft picked the perfect time to <i>act</i> like the number one overall pick in the draft. LeSean McCoy, in his last two outings, has scored 19 and 20 points, respectively. And Ben Roethlisberger, after cooling off from his midseason touchdown barrage, scored 26 in the final week of the regular season. Would Pete dare to make a QB change (again) at this point?<br/>
    <br/>
    <span class="highlighter">Why they might end their season with a whimper:</span> Let&rsquo;s just say it: they&rsquo;re a paper tiger of a playoff team. No other team in the postseason scored less than Boom did throughout the year. They&rsquo;re lucky to be here, and if their faerie dust runs out at any point in the next three weeks, they&rsquo;re finished, because they don&rsquo;t have the overall talent to win against the competition&rsquo;s best.
