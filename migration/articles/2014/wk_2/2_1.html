	Lannie took quite a bit of abuse last week. He spent $375 in the first week of Free Agent Auction Bidding to secure the services of running-back-by-committee member Justin Forsett and Cleveland&rsquo;s unknown third string back, Isaiah Crowell, and the transaction raised more than a few eyebrows across the fantasy football landscape.<br/>
	<br/>
	This stemmed, of course, from IPA&rsquo;s need for a back following the indefinitely suspension of Known Horrible Person, Ray Rice. But the criticism still flowed. The DDL, in particular, <a href="http://jaddl.tumblr.com/post/97154382987/market-watch-week-1-justin-forsett-fever" target="_blank">went to town on IPA</a>. &ldquo;IPA spent approximately 40% of his ENTIRE YEAR&rsquo;S worth of money and got, wait for it: Justin Forsett and Isaiah Crowell. &hellip; IPA&rsquo;s only got about 600 bucks left for the entire rest of the year. I think we can all agree he got a little desperate following a disappointing week one and went certifiably insane.&rdquo;<br/>
	<br/>
	On the other hand, as the blog also points out, Lannie did have a good handle on the market value for the two running backs. The Angry Monkeys bid $250 for Forsett, and Boom offered up $76 for Crowell. (Clearly, Peter is a big fan of <i>The Price is Right</i>, assuming someone else might bid a common interval like $75.)<br/>

	<br/>
	The two new acquisitions have combined to provide The Connoisseur with a grand total of 7.2 points after one week. Not exactly a satisfying return so far (0.019 points per dollar spent).<br/>
	<br/>
	But the criticism seems to have spurred the <i>rest</i> of the IPA roster into an angry frenzy. After scoring a paltry 70.7 in a Week 1 loss to Team Hauloll, IPA bounced back in a big way in Week 2, dominating rival In Pursuit of Perfection, LLC, in a 134.6&ndash;98.2 win (<a href="http://football.fantasysports.yahoo.com/f1/430826/recap?week=2&mid1=2&mid2=8" target="_blank">recap</a>). With the victory, the Wichita War trophy migrates from Nolan&rsquo;s (virtual) mantle to Lannie&rsquo;s.<br/>
	<br/>
	Never one to shy away from self-promotion, Lannie was the first to acknowledge his big weekend in the Twittersphere. &ldquo;IPA is looking much better this week. I see a Briefly Badass coming my way.&rdquo; Expanding upon the tweet when asked about it following the game, Lannie said, &ldquo;Hey, if I don&rsquo;t talk about IPA, who will? You all know the JADDL media is horribly biased against the West Division.&rdquo;<br/>
	<br/>
	Indeed, a Briefly Badass <i>is</i> headed IPA&rsquo;s way; its second B.B. in the last three JADDL regular season weeks (going back to Week 13 of 2013). IPA is the second leading scorer in the league &mdash; behind Team Odouls &mdash; over that span. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re taking the Todd Haley approach: win every three-week period, and we&rsquo;ll get where we want to be by season&rsquo;s end.&rdquo;<br/>
	<br/>
	The turnaround was led by an unlikely entity: the New England D/ST. Unlikely, that is, until you consider they were matched up against the Fighting Matt Cassels. Every player for IPA, in fact, reached double figures &mdash; except Coby Fleener &hellip; and the aforementioned Justin Forsett. IPA won&rsquo;t be able to count on 37 combined points from its kicker and defense every week, naturally, but they should be able to count on even better performances from Peyton Manning. And Arian Foster looks to be back in peak form.<br/>
	<br/>
	As for Pursuit, it&rsquo;s not like 98.2 is a bad score by any means. They just may be the next in line to get screwed over by the scheduling gods, having had 115.9 and 134.6 poured on them in the first two weeks of the season en route to an 0-2 start. That being said, quarterback is going to be a serious issue for IPP LLC if not addressed. RG III is hurt &mdash; again &mdash; and has been massively disappointing even when healthy. Pursuit&rsquo;s back-up, E.J. Manuel, has been better than RG III &hellip; but he&rsquo;s still E.J. Manuel. As you can see, IPP&rsquo;s QB situation is, er, less than desirable.<br/>
	<br/>
	Despite the <i>obvious</i> east &hellip; coast? &hellip; bias of the JADDL media, we&rsquo;ll be keeping a close eye on the West Division race. Four of the six teams are locked at 1-1, and the point differential between the top (Monkeys) and bottom (IPP) is 8.3, with various higher and lower marks between.<br/>
	<br/>
	Things are about to get interesting.
