    	<li>We may check back in on the &ldquo;kings&rdquo; of each position &mdash; see last week&rsquo;s Sampler &mdash; another time, but I don&rsquo;t have time for that, for now. Sorry. Deal with it. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re crushed.</li><br/>
        <li>Will the primary talking point during this football season ever be about, you know, <i>football?</i> First we had the Ray Rice deal. Now it&rsquo;s Adrian Peterson&rsquo;s turn (more like Adrian Beat-his-son, am I right?). What&rsquo;s next? Between these stories, actual football games are, in fact, being played. I&rsquo;m not sure anyone&rsquo;s noticed.<br/>

		Roger Gooddell has a mess on his hands.</li><br/>
		<li>This has been a weird, weird NFL year so far. Atlanta looked great in Week 1, but it turns out New Orleans might just be bad instead, after further review. The Chiefs couldn&rsquo;t have looked worse against Tennessee, then they take Denver to the brink in Mile High. People were ready to declare 16-0 a probability for Seattle, before San Diego &mdash; 2-0 themselves &mdash; put an end to that thought. Philly won&rsquo;t stop spotting teams large leads before storming back for victories. Players are dropping like flies to injuries.<br/>
		<br/>
		It&rsquo;s just been weird, man.</li><br/>
		<li>Speaking of injuries, doesn&rsquo;t it seem like Achilles heels are &mdash; wait for it &mdash; the <i>Achilles heel</i> for NFL players this year? Ba-dum cheeee.</li><br/>
		<li>Check out Team Odouls. 118 last week, 111 this week. Could the Near Beers finally have decided to participate in the Divisions Era?</li><br/>
		<li>On the other side of the coin, let&rsquo;s all pat poor Nolan on the head sympathetically. The 250.5 dumped on his IPP LLC squad through the first two weeks of the season are the third most points put on by opponents in the first two weeks of <i>any</i> season to date. Hang in there, big guy.</li><br/>
		<li>On a brighter note, it took Jesse eight weeks to get his first win in 2013. Now he has one in just two tries. This is the first time Riley County has had a non-losing record since Week 10 of 2012. Things are lookin&rsquo; up!</li><br/>
		<li>After the Draft, Yahoo predicted that the Legion of Boom would go 3-10. We all knew better. After a 2-0 start by Boom, Yahoo should know better, too. Instead, Yahoo now thinks Boom will go 2-11. Wow. I wonder if I can find someone at Yahoo to put money on that&hellip;</li><br/>
		<li>Yahoo doesn&rsquo;t suck at everything, though. Have you guys discovered their <a href="http://football.fantasysports.yahoo.com/f1/430826/recap?week=2&mid1=2&mid2=8" target="_blank">game recaps</a> yet?! They&rsquo;re amazing. A little redundant, if you read them for each game, but amazing nonetheless.</li><br/>
		<li>We had our first major nailbiter of the 2014 season: the Monkeys / Hornets game. This one could be huge, too, as both franchises are trendy picks to compete for Jared&rsquo;s Goblet. The Monkeys needed 3.5 points from T.Y. Hilton on Monday night to eclipse the Hornets, and they got 6.5. Hilton made Jacob sweat it out for quite awhile, though.<br/>
		<br/>
		Should the Hornets wind up finishing behind the Monkeys in the standings, they&rsquo;ll look back at this one as a missed opportunity: the Monkeys got zero points from A.J. Green due to injury, and the Nets still couldnt get the W.</li>
