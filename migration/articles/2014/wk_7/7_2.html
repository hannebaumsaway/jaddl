    <br/>
    Here in the JADDL, we pride ourselves not only on the fantastic fantasy football product we put on the &ldquo;field&rdquo; each and every year, but perhaps even more so on the involvement of its owners. The hilarious amount of time we set aside each fall to JADDL business. The crippling emotional attachment we feel for teams that, in a sense, don&rsquo;t even exist. The camaraderie we enjoy when gathering for the draft.<br/>
    <br/>
    But more than any of that, the JADDL gives us a chance to keep in touch with our friends as our non-fantasy football lives drift in various directions. Because, you know, we&rsquo;re getting old. And old people always have &ldquo;other shit going on,&rdquo; regardless of the shit we have going on that isn&rsquo;t categorized as &ldquo;the other shit.&rdquo;<br/>
    <br/>
    Sure: fantasy football isn&rsquo;t important. We get that. We all know it. But doesn&rsquo;t our involvement and interaction with each other become <i>more</i> important with each passing year? It becomes harder and harder to find excuses to get together, to chat, to email, to whatever. The JADDL is that built-in excuse we get to fall back on, though. It&rsquo;s reliable. It&rsquo;s annual. It works.<br/>
    <div class="news-quote">Win or lose, keep trying. Keep talking. Keep showing us that ginger spark of yours.</div>
    <br/>
    So, Dan, consider this an open letter to you. We miss you. You live in the desert, which made us miss you already.<br/>
    <br/>
    But don&rsquo;t be as distant digitally as you have to be physically, buddy.<br/>
    <br/>
    You haven&rsquo;t tweeted since August 17th, and that was simply to say, &ldquo;I hate Twitter.&rdquo; We all hate Twitter &mdash; at least I think we all hate Twitter. We all use it for one single purpose: JADDL communication. Just tweet about your games or players every once in awhile, or tweet righteous shit-talk to your opponents. Or tweet about the weather. Whatever. Let us know you&rsquo;re there.<br/>
    <br/>
    You&rsquo;ve only spent waiver wire money once in seven weeks, despite having a roster which has brought you all of two wins. You started the Carolina D against the Packers in Green Bay. I mean, to each his own when it comes to fantasy roster management, but &hellip; really?<br/>
    <br/>
    Oh, and that one waiver wire purchase you made? That was your only transaction of the entire season, period, as far as I can tell.<br/>
    <br/>
    According to one anonymous owner, you flat out ignored a trade proposal about a month ago, not even bothering to reject or counter it. You just let it wilt away in your inbox, unheeded.<br/>
    <br/>
    Don&rsquo;t let losing get you down, man. This game is cyclical. You&rsquo;ve won two Court-Ordered Limousines. You were a dynasty of yesteryear, you can be a dynasty again.<br/>
    <br/>
    But win or lose, keep trying. Keep talking. Keep showing us that ginger spark of yours, and we&rsquo;ll all be happier men for it.<br/>
    <br/>
    Your friend,<br/>
    The Commish
