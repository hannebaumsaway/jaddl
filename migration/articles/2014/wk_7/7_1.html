	Back on September 23rd, Aaron Rodgers <a href="http://www.packers.com/media-center/videos/Rodgers-R-E-L-A-X-remix/5b3c8795-d6df-439f-8d36-95aa273b4973" target="_blank">taught his fanbase how to spell a word</a>. The word?<br/>
    <br/>
    R-E-L-A-X.<br/>
    <br/>
    The national media assumed he was delivering that lesson to Green Bay Packers fans, but in truth, the message was intended for fans of the JADDL&rsquo;s Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks. The Longshanks, like the Packers, were 1-2 at the time, and Rodgers himself had had two extremely underwhelming starts. Scratch that: he&rsquo;d had two extremely <i>shitty</i> starts, scoring about 10 points in each game.<br/>
    <br/>
    And still, Rodgers was imploring Shanks fans to chill out, be patient, stick with the team. Initially, the plea fell on deaf ears, as the Shanks proceeded to lose two more games in the following weeks, falling to 1-4. Fans were anything but relaxed. They were irate. But beyond the pitiful record, there were signs, if one chose to look for them. Rodgers was rounding into form as the top three quarterback everyone expected him to be at the season&rsquo;s beginning. The team wasn&rsquo;t catching any scheduling breaks, as their opponents &mdash; Legion of Boom and the Bad News Bensons &mdash; both scored above their season averages against the Shanks. And a nagging injury to Calvin Johnson &mdash; an injury that didn&rsquo;t <i>quite</i> sideline him, but may as well have &mdash; lowered the Shanks&rsquo; scoring ceiling considerably.<br/>
    <br/>
    Whatever the factors were, though, there the Longshanks sat, at 1-4. The All-Whites, as they&rsquo;re affectionately called by their fanbase, were closer to causing panic in the Kansas City metro than they were to calming the waters.<br/>

    <br/>
    Then, just when the season was on the brink of being lost for good, came blessed relief. Relief in the form of interdivision play, and three games against the West Division.<br/>
    <br/>
    The East is 9-3 against the West through the first two weeks of the 2014 Chasm War, and the Longshanks have supplied two of those wins for the right side of the map. Neither of those games has been particularly close, either. The first was a poorly played game between the Shanks and Riley County Comfort in which the Shanks were 16 points &ldquo;less bad&rdquo; than RCC.<br/>
    <br/>
    The latest, though, was a vision of the Shanks that fans have been waiting to see again after a taste in the first week of the season.<br/>
    <br/>
    After scoring 104.9 that week, the Longshanks hadn&rsquo;t been back over a hundred since. Not until they came out this past weekend and swatted the Red Hornets 128.5&ndash;80.8, that is (<a href="http://football.fantasysports.yahoo.com/f1/430826/recap?week=7&mid1=1&mid2=12" target="_blank">game recap</a>). Rodgers paced the Shanks with 26 points, and somewhat unexpected gem Le&rsquo;Veon Bell wasn&rsquo;t far behind with 21 of his own. &ldquo;I wanted no part of Le&rsquo;Veon in the draft,&rdquo; Ryan confessed. &ldquo;He was slotted below his A.D.P. on our board, but he ended up falling so far, we <i>had</i> to take him, albeit begrudgingly.&rdquo;<br/>
    <br/>
    The Longshanks front office isn&rsquo;t begrudging that pick nowadays. Bell is currently the fourth best running back in the JADDL, despite being the <i>fifteenth</i> running back taken in the draft. He has yet to score under 10 so far this year, the epitome of consistency. Consistency that has been extremely necessary through the turmoil of the failed double-tight experiment with Gronk and Gates, Megatron becoming Mega-decoy, and getting new additions Lamar Miller and Roddy White up to speed.<br/>
    <br/>
    Once Calvin Johnson returns &mdash; assuming he&rsquo;s actually healthy this time around, and more than a decoy &mdash; the Shanks should be firing on all cylinders. A-Rod has climbed his way up to the number two spot among league quarterbacks, behind Team Odouls&rsquo; favorite son, Andrew Luck. The Longshanks will need to be at full strength soon, too, because they only get one more game against the West before running through the East gauntlet for a second time. And the Shanks sure do prefer playing outside their own division lately; they went 3-0 against the West a year ago.<br/>
    <br/>
    When asked, however, if he ever wished his franchise was in the West Division because of their struggles in the East, Ryan just laughed and shook his head. &ldquo;I may bat two hundred against a guy throwing fastballs,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;d still rather do that than bat a thousand with a tee.&rdquo;<br/>
    <br/>
    Up next on the tee for the Longshanks is Team Hauloll, which has scored nearly 100 points less than the Shanks to date.
