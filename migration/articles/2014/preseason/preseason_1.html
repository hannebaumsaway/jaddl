	2009: &ldquo;Never in the JADDL&rsquo;s tenure has a team repeated as champions.&rdquo;<br/>
    <br/>
    2010: &ldquo;No team has yet driven home the Limo in back-to-back years in JADDL history.&rdquo;<br/>
    <br/>
    2011: &ldquo;Man, I&rsquo;m getting really tired of writing this preseason article over and over again. Somebody <i>repeat</i> already, would you?&rdquo;<br/>
    <br/>
    2012: &ldquo;Here we are again. Five years of the JADDL have come and gone. Four years of the RBSA came and went before that. And we have yet to see a repeat champion. That can lead us to only one conclusion: winning the league title is really fucking hard.&rdquo;<br/>
    <br/>
    2013: &ldquo;Perhaps we&rsquo;ll finally see a repeat champion.&rdquo;<br/>
    <br/>
    I think you get the picture. Peter has a tall task ahead of him, indeed. But you couldn&rsquo;t find a better repeat candidate than The Mighty &mdash; shit, <i>Legion of</i> Boom. Their list of records and accomplishments is longer than my &hellip; well, it&rsquo;s long. Most career wins. Most career points. Highest single game scores in both the regular season and the playoffs. Most Briefly Badasses. Tied for the most league titles, Jared&rsquo;s Goblets, Virtual Vermeils, and Torn Hoodies.<br/>
    <br/>
    But forget about the staggering numbers and lofty achievements. Peter has that glint in his eye. He&rsquo;s spent the entire off-season polishing and caressing the Court-Ordered Limousine, admiring his reflection in its shimmering silver plating. <i>This is mine. It belongs to me.</i><br/>
    <br/>
    He brought the Limo with him on draft day, as if to show his rivals he isn&rsquo;t worried about them stealing it away from him. If Pete was waging psychological warfare, his offensive was to let his opponents know he brought the trophy and would be taking it back home with him &mdash; both at the end of the day, and the end of the season.<br/>
    <br/>
    <i>This is mine. It belongs to me.</i><br/>
    <br/>
    If he&rsquo;s going to do so, he&rsquo;ll have earned it. Boom must, after all, go through the East Division to get to the promised land; the division that won last year&rsquo;s Chasm War by nearly 500 points. And we forget, sometimes, that among all of Boom&rsquo;s hardware, they have but one Eastern Goblet. The other three belong to the Bensons, and BNB has their own sights set on that Limousine they have yet to secure. Peter, of course, has other ideas. <i>This is mine. It belongs to me.</i><br/>
    <br/>
    Boom will rally its forces around LeSean McCoy for a second consecutive season. Why <i>not</i> lean on the guy that took you to the &rsquo;ship before? Of course, in order to get McCoy back, The Mighty &mdash; fuck! &mdash; <i>Legion</i> had to get the number one overall pick in this year&rsquo;s draft. In doing so, they became the first defending champion in JADDL history to get the first pick in the following draft.<br/>
    <br/>
    So Boom already has a league first heading into this season. Would anyone truly be surprised if they added a couple more firsts to that list? Such as, first franchise to three league titles, first franchise to repeat?<br/>
    <br/>
    <i>This is mine. It belongs to me.</i>
