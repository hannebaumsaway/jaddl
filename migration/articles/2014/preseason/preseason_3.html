<div class="tagline">How the split of 2010 affected JADDL franchises</div>
<div id="article">
	Much talk is thrown around every season &mdash; and perhaps even more in each off-season &mdash; about the supremacy of one JADDL division or the other. And that&rsquo;s good. As I&rsquo;ve said many times, trash talk is one of the pillars that has raised fantasy football to such extraordinary heights in our culture. We&rsquo;re all competitive to a certain extent (some more than others), and this is a way for us to satisfy our competitive thirsts without tearing ACLs, because we&rsquo;re fucking old.<br/>
    <br/>
    This divisional pride was perhaps unforeseen even by the fathers of the divisional system, James and Alex. In their <a href="index.php?view=news&yr=2012&wk=5&pg=3" target="_blank">original proposal</a>, they mention the animosity that can grow between divisional rivals, citing the hatred that brews between the Chiefs, Broncos, and Raiders in the NFL. They also mention the unfamiliarity, bordering on apathy, that would fill the gap between teams from different divisions.<br/>
    <br/>
    However, what we see today includes a third flavor of fallout from switching to divisions. Pride has grown <i>among</i> division rivals for their division <i>itself</i> &hellip; and with it has grown contempt for the other division as a whole.<br/>
    <br/>
    One of the reasons for this is a feeling of unfairness &mdash; and thus, bitterness &mdash; that comes with seeing inferior teams make the playoffs while better teams across the Chasm stay home for the holidays. That bitterness manifests itself in the form of owners bashing the other division at large for supplying such shitty teams to the postseason.<br/>
    <div class="news-quote">If your squad isn&rsquo;t one of those six [playoff] teams, it isn&rsquo;t James&rsquo; fault. It isn&rsquo;t Alex&rsquo;s fault. It&rsquo;s yours.</div>
    <br/>
    A year ago, the Longshanks finished dead last (again) in the East despite scoring a franchise-record 1,253 points. Meanwhile, all three playoff representatives from the West scored fewer points than the Shanks. In 2011, Team Hauloll endured similar agony while watching the Bensons hoist the Eastern Goblet with fewer points than Hauloll, which didn&rsquo;t qualify for the postseason (they finished 4th in the West that year).<br/>
    <br/>
    That imbalance is something James and Alex <i>did</i> predict: &ldquo;What if one division is way better than the other? OMFG! Couldn&rsquo;t a potentially good team get screwed if it ended up in a stacked division? Well, yes, but &hellip; for every good team that gets shoved out, a lesser quality team would get in! One team&rsquo;s bitter fortune is the answer to another team&rsquo;s desperate prayer.&rdquo;<br/>
    <br/>
    Besides, if we wanted to pick playoff teams straight down the points line, we wouldn&rsquo;t even have match-ups, wins, and losses. We would just play 13 weeks and take the top six point-scorers.<br/>
    <br/>
    Booooooooring.<br/>
    <br/>
    No, this way is better. And like so many things in life, divisional supremacy cycles anyway. Sure, the dominance of the East is fresh in our minds <i>now</i>, but we forget that that was the <i>first time</i> the East outscored the West in the regular season. It was all West before that, including a record 700-point margin in 2011; a mark the East didn&rsquo;t even sniff a year ago (when the margin between divisions was 496). Last year was also the first time the East came out on top in inter-divisional play (11-7). They&rsquo;re 33-38 lifetime against the West in those three magical weeks in the middle of the season.<br/>
    <br/>
    What I&rsquo;m trying to say is, dominance is a fickle beast, and the owners in the East should remember that before crowing too loudly about their perceived superiority in 2014.<br/>
    <br/>
    But that was all a long tangent, as it turns out. The purpose of this article is really to examine how the move to divisions affected the fine franchises of this league individually. Who were the big winners and losers of the breakup from four years ago?<br/>
    <br/>
    <div class="section-header">The grass really is greener</div>
    Divisions were a desperately welcome change to the league for <b>IPA Connoisseur</b> and the <b>Angry Monkeys</b>, who have shared remarkably similar fortunes over the course of the league&rsquo;s history. Like, nearly identical fortunes. Both teams won 13 games apiece in the three years prior to divisions, and have won 29 games apiece in the four years since. Both have posted .558 winning percentages in the divisional era, after batting .333 (Monkeys) and .346 (IPA, thanks to a tie) before. They only had one playoff appearance between them prior to 2010: IPA was a wild card in 2009. Since then, they&rsquo;ve made six combined appearances, including appearances for both teams each of the last three years. IPA even won the West in 2012.<br/>
    <br/>
    <b>Lawrence Football Jesus</b> has also, quite fittingly, enjoyed the divisions era. Ten wins in the three non-division years, 24 wins since &hellip; though playoff participation is stagnant for LFJ, with one appearance both before and after the split.<br/>
    <br/>
    Of these new era winners, Connoisseur is the team that truly stepped its game up from era to era. Before 2010, IPA averaged 1,049 points per season. Since, they&rsquo;ve averaged 1,241. That&rsquo;s the biggest jump in season average for any franchise in the league before and after the split.<br/>
    <br/>
    <div class="section-header">Don&rsquo;t know what you got &rsquo;til it&rsquo;s gone</div>
    The picture is far bleaker for the likes of <b>Team Odouls</b> and the <b>Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks,</b> as you probably guessed. The split dropped those teams&rsquo; winning percentages by .365 and .327, respectively. Odouls won 30 games &mdash; 30 games! &mdash; in the three years before divisions, and just 21 in the four years after. That may not sound awful, until you put it in these terms: before divisions, Odouls averaged 10 wins per year; with divisions, that number dips to five &hellip; as in, half as good. Or twice as bad. Take your pick.<br/>
    <br/>
    As for the Shanks, they went from eight wins per year to four, so the story is comparable.<br/>
    <br/>
    On the left side of the map, the <b>Red Hornets</b> have had the sting taken out of them by the split to a degree <a target="_blank" href="index.php?view=news&yr=2011&wk=3&pg=3">that parallels the Shanks&rsquo; demise</a>: eight wins per year before, four wins per year now.<br/>
    <br/>
    Doubling down on suck.<br/>
    <br/>
    In terms of raw points, only Odouls and the Hornets are scoring less per year in the divisions era than they did prior.<br/>
    <br/>
    There you have it. The beneficiaries and victims of the dream James and Alex had over four years ago. Just remember: in the pre-divisions era, like now, six teams made it to the postseason. If your squad isn&rsquo;t one of those six teams, it isn&rsquo;t James&rsquo; fault. It isn&rsquo;t Alex&rsquo;s fault. It&rsquo;s yours. It&rsquo;s your fault.<br/>
    <br/>
    So be one of those six teams this year.
