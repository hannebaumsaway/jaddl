    Ta-ta for now, Worldwide Leader.<br/>
    <br/>
    After 11 years with ESPN, the ownership of the JADDL voted to pack up and head over to Yahoo!. All right, that&rsquo;s the last time I&rsquo;m going to use the exclamation point in the name, because I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re still supposed to supply punctuation at the end of the sentence or not. And that &ldquo;11 years&rdquo; timeline is possibly an approximation, because historical records from those days are hazy and sparse. They were prehistoric times, after all &mdash; remember <i>paying</i> for live scoring?! Medieval!<br/>
    <br/>
    Commissioner Hannebaum had quietly been researching other fantasy hosts for a couple years now, always in search of ways to improve the user experience for his league. The move was finally triggered, however, by a need to satisfy a JADDL rule change.<br/>
    <br/>
    On June 10th, a proposal was adopted to change the JADDL waiver wire to an auction format. On July 31st, a notice was posted to the league that ESPN would not be able to handle waiver wire auctions the way the owners expected, and a choice would have to be made: abandon auction bidding, or abandon ESPN.<br/>
	<br/>
	Five days later, the league, never afraid to adapt and grow, chose the latter. And so we embark on a new adventure in 2014 with our new partner, Yahoo.<br/>
	<br/>
	Here are some things to look out for as you navigate this alien world.<br/>
    <br/>
    <div class="section-header">Rivalry Week</div><img alt="" class="cover" src="assets/images/articles/2014/rivalry-week-ss.jpg" />
    It doesn&rsquo;t actually do anything, functionally, but Yahoo has a fun little &ldquo;Rivalry Week&rdquo; feature that allows us to designate one of the weeks of the season as, well, Rivalry Week. Think about college teams that always play each other around Thanksgiving each year, etc. That&rsquo;s what this is. You&rsquo;ll now play your rival in Week 10 of each season.<br/>
    <br/>
    It was actually surprisingly easy to break out each rival couple. We can come up with names for each game more collaboratively if necessary, but let&rsquo;s take a stab here just for shits:<br/>
    <br/>
    <b>Bensons v. Falcons</b> &mdash; The Family Feud<br/>
    <b>Hornets v. Hauloll</b> &mdash; Duel in the Desert<br/>
    <b>IPA v. IPP</b> &mdash; The Wichita War <i>or</i> Battle for Acronym Supremacy<br/>
    <b>Boom v. Shanks</b> &mdash; The Velvet Rivalry<br/>
    <b>Monkeys v. Comfort</b> &mdash; The Manhattan Project<br/>
    <b>Odouls v. Jesus</b> &mdash; The Hidden Rivalry (<a target="_blank" href="index.php?view=news&yr=2013&wk=5&pg=2">see here</a>)<br/>
    <br/>
    Also, I&rsquo;m going to be introducing trophies for each of these games&rsquo; winners to hold in their collections each year! Unlike our other virtual trophies, however, there will be only one instance of each, so only the team with scoreboard in the rivalry will hold the trophy. The Big 10 doesn&rsquo;t do much right, but trophies for ancient rivalries is one of them.<br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway, gear up your game in Week 10, because bragging rights are earned twofold in Rivalry Week.<br/>
    <br/>
    <div class="section-header">League Pick &rsquo;Em</div><img alt="" class="cover" src="assets/images/articles/2014/yahoo-pickem-ss.jpg" />
    Yahoo fuels bragging rights in another way, too. They have a League Pick &rsquo;Em that runs as a sort of mini-game alongside the real (fantasy) football. It&rsquo;s pretty simple: you pick the winners of each game, each week, and Yahoo tracks the results. It doesn&rsquo;t contribute in any way to the actual league standings, but it could provide some funny talking points for us as the season goes on. Let&rsquo;s do it.<br/>
    <br/>
    <div class="section-header">Dynamic Projections</div><img alt="" class="cover" src="assets/images/articles/2014/yahoo-matchup-ss.jpg" />
    Yahoo may just do a <i>slightly</i> better job of predicting winners than ESPN did. Of course, ESPN was terrible at it. They thought every team was going to average about 130 points each game.<br/>
    <br/>
    Yahoo expands upon their projections with a nice dynamic chances-of-winning feature. As the points come tumbling in, watch your matchup &mdash; and others &mdash; to see who&rsquo;s got the edge at any given point in time. It&rsquo;ll be fun to see what long odds teams are able to overcome. I&rsquo;ll be paying particularly close attention to this during the Hidden Rivalry.<br/>
    <br/>
    Oh, and the matchup pages are a handy place to make your Pick &rsquo;Em picks, too.<br/>
    <br/>
    <div class="section-header">Smack Talk</div><img alt="" class="cover" src="assets/images/articles/2014/yahoo-smack-ss.jpg" />
    ESPN had smack talk too, but it was hard to find and generally horrible. Yahoo makes their Smack Talk much more prominent and accessible. You can see all the banter going back and forth league-wide from the league&rsquo;s home page, or each individual matchup&rsquo;s smack from that matchup&rsquo;s page.<br/>
    <br/>
    So I encourage you to make use of the feature. Talking shit is, after all, most of what fantasy football is all about.<br/>
    <br/>
    There&rsquo;s more to love about Yahoo than what I&rsquo;ve mentioned here; things like hilariously in-depth-yet-occasionally-inaccurate draft report cards, which <a href="http://jaddl.tumblr.com/post/95103885677/yahoo-is-all-about-the-draft-report" target="_blank">The DDL was all over</a>. Go dig around in the site and see what you can find for yourselves.<br/>
    <br/>
    Not everything is rosy with the move, however. There are a couple obstacles we&rsquo;ll have to maneuver through.<br/>
    <br/>
    <div class="section-header">The I.R. Slot</div>
    With ESPN, you were allowed to put players with the status of &ldquo;Out&rdquo; in the I.R. slot on your bench, giving you a safety net of sorts to take a flier on an injured player, or hold on to an injured stud longer than you otherwise would be able to.<br/>
    <br/>
    With Yahoo, that safety net is gone. Only players with the actual status of &ldquo;I.R.&rdquo; are allowed in the I.R. slot. So your roster decision making just got a little tougher. There is a feature request put in to make the I.R. slot akin to the one on ESPN and others, so this may be a one-year issue, but we&rsquo;ll have to wait and see.<br/>
    <br/>
    <div class="section-header">Team Name Length</div>
    This one is purely an aesthetic inconvenience, but hey, we in the JADDL are all about aesthetics. Yahoo has an absurdly dated 20-character limit on fantasy team names. Again, Yahoo has a feature request in hand to expand the limit, but for now, we&rsquo;re stuck with team names like &ldquo;IPP LLC&rdquo; and &ldquo;Football Jesus.&rdquo;<br/>
    <br/>
    Don&rsquo;t worry, though: you&rsquo;ll always be In Pursuit of Perfection, LLC and Lawrence Football Jesus in our hearts.
