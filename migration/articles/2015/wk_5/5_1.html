    A few weeks ago, the Bad News Bensons were in a bad place indeed. After easily dispatching of a watered down Odouls squad, the Bensons entered Week 2 with a decent amount of optimism. Optimism that would soon not just dwindle, but would be crushed into a fine powder-like substance when BNB scored just 61.9 points in an uncompetitive game against arch-rival Millennium Falcons.<br/>
    <br/>
    The final total wasn&rsquo;t even indicative of the problems the Bensons were faced with. Only one player in that game scored in double figures, and that player was the kicker, Justin Tucker&mdash;coincidentally, the target of the season&rsquo;s first trade. The most prominent warning sign of trouble ahead was Andrew Luck, who scored 8.4 and looked bad doing it. And if Luck was 1A on the list of Bensons issues, Jeremy Hill had to be 1B. Hill barely inched above zero (0.1, to be exact). That wouldn&rsquo;t cut it for a tenth rounder, let alone the 15th overall pick.<br/>
    <br/>
    Yes, things were looking grim. You know how everyone <em>really</em> knew things were grim? Alex began shopping his players around, hunting for a deal to be made, as only Alex does. Week 2? Shortcomings? BLOW IT UP, SEE WHO&rsquo;S AVAILABLE!<br/>
    <div class="news-quote">I was concerned. My top two draft picks were playing like they were on the Longshanks or something.<div class="author">Alex</div></div>
    <br/>
    But no trade was acceptable to any potential partners, and Alex soldiered on with his seemingly broken team. The next week showed improvement on the scoreboard (90.9 points), but not in the standings, as the Bensons would fall to The Mighty Boom and drop to 1-2, below .500 for the first time since Week 5 of last season. This shouldn&rsquo;t have shaken Alex, seeing as how he started 0-3 in 2014 before closing out on a 9-1 tear. But it did.<br/>
    <br/>
    &ldquo;I was concerned. My top two draft picks were playing like they were on the Longshanks or something, and I wasn&rsquo;t sure I had an answer,&rdquo; said Alex.<br/>
    <br/>
    Then he had a stroke of genius. He decided to invite a local legend to come give a little pep talk to his troops, see if he couldn&rsquo;t get them to play at the level of which he knew them capable. &ldquo;I called up Ned Yost, <em>who I always believed in</em>, and asked him to speak to my guys,&rdquo; Alex explained. &ldquo;He graciously agreed.&rdquo;<br/>
    <br/>
    Yost came and spoke to the Bensons before the start of the MLB playoffs, before Week 4 of the JADDL season. According to reports, he talked about a great many things&mdash;hunting, NASCAR, the Atlanta Braves&mdash;but not much about winning or fantasy football strategy. &ldquo;It was a little odd, man,&rdquo; said DeAndre Hopkins of the meeting. &ldquo;He just kept talking about random stuff in this really calm voice, and confused the hell out of us. But before we knew it, we were all fired up for some reason.&rdquo;<br/>
    <br/>
    Whatever was said, it seems to have worked. The Bensons went out and won a thriller against then-points leader Lawrence Football Jesus in Week 4. Jeremy Hill exploded for 24 points to carry the team in its first Andrew Luck-less appearance. This past weekend, the Bensons backed up that victory with a far more resounding performance: a 141.2&ndash;83.9 beatdown of the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks. This time around, Jeremy Hill was the only one who <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> contribute. But perhaps his example the week prior set the tone for everyone else. Fellow running back Doug Martin led the way with 33.8. Quarterback fill-in Blake Bortles added a very improbable 28.1 points to the total. Hopkins and James Jones both scored over 15 apiece, and new addition Gary Barnidge poured on 20 of his own.<br/>
    <br/>
    The domination was thorough and complete.<br/>
    <br/>
    Suddenly, the Bensons find themselves in second place in the East behind Boom, a team they&rsquo;ve scored about 40 more points than. The Bensons aren&rsquo;t perfect, but the truth is, the East is chock full of broken teams this year. It&rsquo;s like the AL Central of the JADDL. Jesus, whom many people&mdash;James among them&mdash;thought could run away with the Eastern Goblet, has quietly slipped to 2-3. The current leader, Boom, just scored 68 points and <em>won</em> because the Millennium Falcons were even worse that day.<br/>
    <br/>
    The East may be a war of attrition this year; a game of King of the Mountain with a very short, squatty-looking mountain. And in such a game, the one with the most experience could have a considerable advantage. Look over there: it&rsquo;s Alex and his three Eastern Goblets&hellip;
