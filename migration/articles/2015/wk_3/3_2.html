    You all remember #TheCurse, right? The doomed 2011 campaign of the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks&hellip;how could you forget? I wouldn&rsquo;t let you.<br/>
    <br/>
    A refresher: four years ago, the Longshanks went 3-9-1, and had their season brought to its knees by things like&hellip;<br/>

	And so on. If you&rsquo;re bored, you really should peruse the entire @FightinShanks Twitter feed from September to November 2011. It&rsquo;s a highly entertaining read. But now we move on, to today. You see, #TheCurse isn&rsquo;t just about losing. No, it&rsquo;s far more sophisticated than that. It&rsquo;s about losing <em>spectacularly</em>. The &rsquo;11 Longshanks made losing an art form. Don&rsquo;t lose by 10 when you can lose by 0.1. Don&rsquo;t watch your opponent&rsquo;s first round pick have a nice day against you; watch his waiver wire handcuff have a career day against you. Don&rsquo;t make it just about the final score; immerse yourself into the bizarre plays in the NFL games that led to that final score.<br/>
    <br/>
    In that spirit, we may have a new host emerging for #TheCurse2015: Team Hauloll.<br/>
    <br/>
    These are early days, of course, but Jason is already feeling the sting of bad fortune creeping up his spine. Hauloll started off the season by watching a large lead over the Angry Monkeys slip away and finally disappear in the final quarter of a Monday Night double-header thanks to unheralded Carlos Hyde&rsquo;s 30 points. Hyde hasn&rsquo;t scored over seven since. But even with Hyde&rsquo;s explosion, Hauloll would have won had Sam Bradford been awarded a touchdown on a Jordan Matthews reception where he was ruled out at the one yard line even though replays clearly showed that he broke the plane of the end zone. Instead of challenging the ruling, which would have given Hauloll four more points in a game they eventually lost by three, Chip Kelly did Chip Kelly things, and hurried up with a run from the one, and Hauloll&rsquo;s opportunity to tack on the points they rightfully earned was lost.<br/>
    <br/>

    Two weeks later, Jason would find himself and his team on the wrong side of Lady Luck once again.<br/>
    <br/>
    Midway through the third quarter of the Steelers-Rams game, Ben Roethlisberger went down in pain, and would not return. Hauloll doesn&rsquo;t have Big Ben&hellip;but he does have Antonio Brown. At that point in the game, Brown had an impressive 108 yards receiving, for 10.8 points. After the Roethlisberger injury, when former IPP championship quarterback Michael Vick took over, Brown was targeted just once; an incompletion. Zero points. That doesn&rsquo;t bode well for Brown&rsquo;s production over the next six weeks, which would be more than long enough to bury Hauloll&rsquo;s playoff hopes.<br/>
    <br/>
    That wasn&rsquo;t even the most painful aspect of the IPP game for Hauloll. Hauloll running back Tevin Coleman fractured his ribs in Week 2 and was unavailable against Pursuit. His carries for Atlanta would inevitably go to Devonta Freeman&hellip;who is owned by IPP. Freeman crafted a highlight reel that would prove nightmarish for Hauloll fans, gaining 193 all-purpose yards and three touchdowns for 37.3 fantasy points. Now, maybe Hauloll wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten 37.3 more points had Coleman played, but IPP certainly wouldn&rsquo;t have, either. And IPP ended up winning the game by 18.<br/>
    <br/>
    Even Hauloll&rsquo;s bench and trade bait is being unjustly robbed of points. If you look at the box score of the Hauloll-IPP game, you&rsquo;ll see that Tyler Eifert had zero points on Hauloll&rsquo;s bench. What the box score <em>won&rsquo;t</em> tell you is that Eifert was the victim of that infamous &ldquo;catch rule.&rdquo; A play that any reasonable person would watch and say, &ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s a touchdown,&rdquo; is ruled on in a much more NFL-ish (read: moronic) way as an incomplete pass. See for yourself:<br/>
    <br/>

    <br/>
    And so has gone the 2015 season so far for Team Hauloll. If they keep racking up losses, we&rsquo;ll all have to keep an eye on <em>how</em> they&rsquo;re losing along the way. It could make for another fascinating tale in the saga of #TheCurse.
