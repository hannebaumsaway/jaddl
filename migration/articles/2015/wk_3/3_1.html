    A year ago, Riley County Comfort was given a &ldquo;D-&rdquo; draft grade from Jake Gutierrez. Undeterred, they proceeded to go 7-3 against their Western foes (7-6 overall) and make the playoffs for the first time since their Cammy Cam Juice-fueled championship run in 2011.<br/>
    <br/>
    This year, though RCC didn&rsquo;t show up in Dr. Roto&rsquo;s bottom two, the general consensus among league owners at draft headquarters was, <em>What the hell is Jesse doing?</em> He took Jonathan Stewart in the fourth round as his third running back, before he had a second receiver or a single quarterback. Three picks later he took Jeremy Maclin&mdash;you know, the same Jeremy Maclin whose production is dependent on Check-Down Charlie (Alex Smith). Jesse&rsquo;s next pick was Brandon Marshall, who is dependent on <s>Geno Smith</s> Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br/>
    <br/>
    That&rsquo;s quite the sm&ouml;rg&aring;sbord of receivers.<br/>
    <div class="news-quote">Maybe Jesse is the Billy Beane of the JADDL.</div>
    <br/>
    To cap it off, RCC selected Larry Fitzgerald in the ninth round, mainly so Brandon Marshall wouldn&rsquo;t sulk about being the oldest fucker on the team.<br/>
    <br/>
    Yes, pundits were once again perplexed and underwhelmed by Riley County&rsquo;s draft performance. Jesse wasn&rsquo;t, though. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m diggin&rsquo; my draft outcome,&rdquo; he said in the days following the draft.<br/>
    <br/>
    Maybe he knows something the rest of us don&rsquo;t. Maybe Jesse is the Billy Beane of the JADDL, finding value in players overlooked by others for not passing the eye test&mdash;like, literally a vision exam at an optometrist&rsquo;s. Maybe Universal Studios will release a movie called <em>Oldball</em>, and Jesse will be portrayed by Rob Lowe or someone.<br/>
    <br/>
    Or maybe not. But that won&rsquo;t change the fact that RCC defied expectations by making the playoffs last year, and they look like they want to do even more this time around, marching out to a 3-0 record with a 143.2&ndash;79.9 pasting of the Red Hornets. The huge weekend puts Comfort second in points league-wide, behind only white-hot Football Jesus. The general trend is promising for RCC as well: they&rsquo;ve scored more in each week than the previous week (though it&rsquo;s unlikely they&rsquo;ll be able to sustain that and surpass 143 points next week).<br/>
    <br/>
    And maybe not being Billy Beane isn&rsquo;t such a bad thing. After all, Billy Beane hasn&rsquo;t actually won jack shit, while anti-<em>Moneyball</em> GM Dayton Moore just #YOLO&rsquo;d his way to a pennant&hellip;<br/>
    <br/>
    As for that&hellip;questionable&hellip;receiving corps?<br/>
    <br/>
    It looked like the pundits would be right after Week 1. Emmanuel Sanders&mdash;referred to as &ldquo;youngster&rdquo; by his teammates&mdash;and Maclin combined for just 11.7 points. Brandon Marshall did put up 12.2 by himself on Comfort&rsquo;s bench, but the bench is where he stayed in Week 2, when he upped his ante to 16.1. Those wasted points were overlooked, however, as the youthful Sanders scored 20.7 of his own in another RCC victory.<br/>
    <br/>
    What <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> go overlooked on RCC&rsquo;s bench was the fact that Larry Fitzgerald came out of nowhere to score a whopping 29.2 points. That was plenty good enough to earn him a start in Week 3 against the Hornets, and he would reward Jesse&rsquo;s faith with 25.4 more points. Marshall got a starting spot as well, and hardly disappointed with 14.9.<br/>
    <br/>
    This was all coupled with breakout performances from Jamaal Charles (26.2) and Matty &ldquo;Ice&rdquo; Ryan (25.1). The Seahawks D/ST and even Stephen Gostkowski got in on the 15+ point action, and the rout was on.<br/>
    <br/>
    We&rsquo;ll see if Riley County can continue to rout the West as a whole. The road gets tougher with the Angry Monkeys (2-1) and In Pursuit of Perfection (3-0). Then it&rsquo;s off to interdivision play, where Comfort is just 1-5 over the past two years.<br/>
    <br/>
    Jesse must hope Fitzgerald and Marshall don&rsquo;t fall and break their hips before then.
