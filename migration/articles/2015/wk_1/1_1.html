    The first quarter is over in the final game of the weekend on Monday night.<br/>
    <br/>
    Team Hauloll is sitting pretty, holding a 110.4&ndash;82.2 lead over the defending champs. Hauloll&rsquo;s players are finished, but who cares, right? The Angry Monkeys aren&rsquo;t going to erase that kind of deficit with just three quarters of Carlos Hyde and Mike Wallace left in the chamber.<br/>
    <br/>
    The second quarter comes to an end. Hyde and Wallace tack on 13.6 as Hyde begins to heat up. Hauloll still controls just under a 15 point lead with a half to play. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not nervous,&rdquo; Jason tells friends in his suite as the players jog into the locker room. &ldquo;The Monkeys are new money, and we&rsquo;re the class of the West. Things will end as they should.&rdquo;<br/>
    <br/>
    Landoll&rsquo;s confidence balloons as the third quarter comes and goes. Both Hyde and Wallace are stymied, combining for just 2.9 points in the frame. Only 15 minutes remain in the game, and the Monkeys still trail by over 11. Soon, Hauloll will be 1-0 on their march toward a third Jared&rsquo;s Goblet, and the Monkeys will being wondering whether last year&rsquo;s title was a fluke.<br/>
    <br/>
    Tick. Tock.<br/>
    <br/>
    Three minutes fall off the clock. Hyde manages just seven yards on three carries to open a drive. Then, a small crack opens up in Hauloll&rsquo;s defense: Hyde picks up 18 yards, and the Monkeys inch to within 10. The clock continues its hypnotic decay and informs the crowd that there is 9:44 remaining. 9:44 remaining when Hyde takes a handoff from the 17 yard line and goes off-tackle to the 10&hellip;to the five&hellip;<br/>

    <em>Touchdown.</em><br/>

    Jason is no longer chatting with his friends up in his suite. He&rsquo;s pacing in front of the snack bar, trying to will the clock to wind faster. The margin is suddenly down to a point and a half. But a win by a point and a half is still a win. Margins aren&rsquo;t remembered as time goes by. Only victories.<br/>
    <br/>
    The ball is out of Hyde&rsquo;s hands anyway&mdash;until an interception gives it right back to his side. 19 seconds later, Hyde rips off a 14 yard gain, and the Monkeys have climbed all the way to within a hair of Team Hauloll. Jason isn&rsquo;t pacing anymore. He&rsquo;s sitting down with his head in his hands, waiting for the guillotine to finally drop. But the torture would be thorough. Hyde&rsquo;s next carry is for a single yard, evening the score right down to the decimal point. The execution isn&rsquo;t carried out until Hyde catches a pass out of the backfield for eight more yards, pulling the Monkeys ahead&mdash;and leaving them there.<br/>
    <br/>
    Hyde tacks on another 17 yards for good measure, and the Monkeys escape the Phoenix metro with an improbable&mdash;and equally impressive&mdash;victory, by a score of 113.5&ndash;110.4. The two touchdowns and 182 yards from scrimmage (30.2 points) put Hyde atop the running back leaderboard after a week of play. His performance washed away the would-be story of Travis Kelce tallying two touchdowns of his own en route to 24.6 points.<br/>
    <br/>
    Nine months ago, Tulsa won its first championship in franchise history by toppling one of the most prestigious teams in the East, Team Odouls. This past weekend, they began their title defense by toppling <em>the</em> most prestigious team in the West.<br/>
    <br/>
    &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not interested in how good other teams have been in the past, or how much of a fraud they think we are now,&rdquo; Jacob said following the game. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to pay to ship the Limo somewhere, so I think I&rsquo;ll just keep it.&rdquo;<br/>
    <br/>
    There&rsquo;s no arguing the Monkeys&rsquo; star is on the rise. Since they ditched the Flying Pigs name and re-branded in 2011, they&rsquo;ve had nothing but winning seasons. Getting to 1-0 is the first step toward continuing that trend. The next step isn&rsquo;t any easier, as they face off with the only team in the West to outscore them in Week 1: In Pursuit of Perfection, LLC.<br/>
    <br/>
    2015 is officially out of the gate, and the defending champs are off to the races.
