    It hasn&rsquo;t been the smoothest of rides, but nonetheless, the ride continues for Team Odouls in 2015.<br>
    <br>
    If you&rsquo;ll recall, Odouls started out the year with four straight losses, never scoring above 81 in any of them. But before anyone could revv up 0-and-13 Watch in full force, Odouls rebounded to score in triple digits and get its first win in Week 5 over Lawrence Football Jesus. Then they won again. And again. Oh-and-four turned into three-and-four that quickly, and in the putrid East Division, that was good enough for a tie for third at the time.<br>
    <br>
    Through interdivisional play, Odouls managed to reach the 100 mark in every game (I rounded up from 99.9 for Odouls&rsquo; game against the Hornets, deal with it). Arian Foster had returned from injury, Andrew Luck had recovered from whatever the fuck was going on with him, and Odouls looked mighty respectable all of a sudden.<br>
    <br>
    When division games resumed, Odouls didn&rsquo;t slow down. In fact, Adam managed to even his record at 5-5 with two consecutive wins against the Bad News Bensons and Football Jesus&mdash;completing a season sweep over his rival in the process. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny how season goals can change from week to week,&rdquo;says Adam. &ldquo;When we beat Jesus the first time, it made us 1-4, and we thought, OK, just sweep Jesus so we can salvage <em>something</em> from this awful season. By the time we beat them the second time, though, we barely even noticed the significance. Our thoughts had moved on to bigger things. Also, LFJ was 3-7 at the time, so.&rdquo;<br>
    <br>
    The good vibes from a .500 record and domination of their rival soon subsided, however, with an extremely disappointing effort in an 88.5&ndash;63.4 loss to The Mighty Boom in Week 11, an outcome which sent the Eastern Goblet Boom&rsquo;s way, and sent Team Odouls into must-win territory.<br>
    <br>
    Or so everyone assumed.<br>

    <br>
    But, as it turns out, the East is <em>so freaking bad</em> that Odouls actually <em>isn&rsquo;t</em> in a must-win situation. They could get into the playoffs&mdash;indeed, they could actually finish second in the division&mdash;with a 6-7 record. If Odouls gets that sixth win, they just need either the Millennium Falcons or the Bensons to lose their remaining two games, and Odouls would be in. Odouls does need to get at least one more win, though, as they would lose any tied scenario with multiple 5-8 teams.<br>
    <br>
    The simplest solution for Odouls, of course, is to win out. They control their own destiny; 7-6 gets them in no matter what, since that would entail handing a loss to the Falcons, which would drop the Falcons&rsquo; ceiling to 6-7.<br>
    <br>
    It&rsquo;s unclear whether the prospect of Team Odouls in the postseason would scare Boom or anyone else. By points, Odouls is the second weakest team in the league, ahead of only the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks. However, playoff experience abounds in the Odouls front office. They&rsquo;ve played in seven postseason games since 2007, tied for fourth most in the league. Moreover, that&rsquo;s in just four playoff appearances total; in three of those four years, Odouls made it all the way to the Jared Bowl. Of course, we know how those Jared Bowls turned out&hellip;<br>
