    We just don&rsquo;t hear a lot from Dan Romans these days. He drafts his team in August with everybody else. He manages his roster throughout the season. He even made a trade! He just does these things in relative silence.<br>
    <br>
    And maybe that&rsquo;s by design.<br>
    <br>
    Tucked away in the corner of the map, the Red Hornets can fly under the radar, no pun intended, while they rebuild their once-proud franchise. They won a title in 2004, and again in 2007. They missed the playoffs in 2008 by a mere 9.9 points, and rebounded to return to the postseason in 2009. A year later, they again narrowly missed advancing due to tiebreakers.<br>
    <br>
    That&rsquo;s where the happy path ends. The Hornets haven&rsquo;t finished higher than fifth in the West Division since then. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why we fell off,&rdquo; Dan says on the matter. &ldquo;If I knew, I&rsquo;d probably fix it. I&rsquo;m not a moron.&rdquo;<br>
    <br>
    So yes, the Hornets are in rebuilding mode. And maybe, just maybe, 2015 is the glimpse of light their fans have been waiting for, like the electricity in a newly constructed highrise flickering to life. If they average over 107 points in their last two games, they&rsquo;ll score more this season than they have since 2009, a season that included a playoff appearance. But more importantly, of course, is the fact that we&rsquo;re heading into Week 12, and the Hornets are still in the race.<br>
    <br>
    Technically.<br>
    <br>
    It&rsquo;s not the <em>longest</em> of shots anyone has ever heard of, but it isn&rsquo;t low-hanging fruit, either. The Hornets can forget about catching In Pursuit of Perfection. While the two teams did split in the regular season thanks to the Hornets&rsquo; 92.9&ndash;51.9 victory this past weekend, IPP is just a <em>tad</em> ahead of the Hornets in points&hellip;202.3 points ahead, to be exact.<br>

    <br>
    No, it&rsquo;s Riley County Comfort the Hornets must set their sights on tracking down now. As I said, it won&rsquo;t be easy&hellip;but it&rsquo;s doable. First and foremost, the Hornets have to take care of business this weekend against the already-eliminated-with-nothing-to-play-for IPA Connoisseur. They also need Riley County to drop their game against also-eliminated-with-nothing-to-play-for Team Hauloll. That would ratchet the intensity and pressure of the Hornets-Comfort tilt in the final week of the regular season to an 11, on a scale of one to 10. Win that game, and the Hornets would catch Comfort at 7-6 (5-5). The two would split their regular season meetings as well, so it would all come down to points.<br>
    <br>
    This is where style points come in. It&rsquo;s almost like the JADDL is pulling from the now defunct BCS system. In addition to winning out and Comfort losing out, the Hornets need to outscore RCC by 60.3 in the final two weeks. Again: doable, but quite difficult. If you consider the fact that the Hornets&rsquo; high water mark this season is 111.3, and Riley County&rsquo;s <em>low</em> mark is 70.0, which is a difference of 41.3&hellip;well, maybe this task is a longer shot than I initially credited it.<br>
    <br>
    But hey, it&rsquo;s not over until the fat lady sings, <a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/sports/college/iowa-state/football/2015/11/21/mark-mangino-tweet-paul-rhoads-iowa-state-cyclones-kansas-state-wildcats-ending/76111296/" target="_blank">as Mark Mangino would say</a>! Good luck, Dan-O.
