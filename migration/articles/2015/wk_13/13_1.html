    This is one of those articles that practically writes itself, yet at the same time, I wish it was someone else&rsquo;s job to write it. Because no words I can type here could <em>possibly</em> do this past weekend&rsquo;s shenanigans justice.<br>
    <br>
    Once it was clear Riley County Comfort wasn&rsquo;t going to lose to the Red Hornets by about 60, the intrigue in the West evaporated. But in the East &hellip; ohhhh, mama, the East gave us a night JADDL fans will remember forever.<br>
    <br>
    While Mighty Boom fans rested happily, all snug in their beds, it was Team Odouls which snagged the first of the two outstanding playoff invites when they overcame the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks&rsquo; second best game of the year and secured that all-important seventh victory. That game was in doubt well into Sunday night, until Big Ben Roethlisberger and Old Frank Gore combined for 51 points in the final game of the evening.<br>
    <br>
    But that was nothing&mdash;<em>nothing</em>&mdash;compared to the fireworks still to come.<br>
    <br>
    The sun rose on Monday morning like it always does; bright and steady, a rippling symbol of a fresh start and new possibilities. In California as in Kansas, fans of the Millennium Falcons and Bad News Bensons looked to this day as <em>the</em> day, the day when their team would clinch that third and final playoff spot. After that, anything would truly be possible. Remember: the Bensons controlled their own destiny, while the Falcons needed some help from Boom. Going into Monday Night Football, the Bensons led Boom by 5.8, and Boom had just one bullet left in the chamber: Dez Bryant.<br>
    <br>
    The Falcons, meanwhile, trailed Lawrence Football Jesus by five, and had only the Washington running back <em>du jour</em>&mdash;Matt Jones or Alfred Morris&mdash;remaining. Late into the evening Sunday, Ian still hadn&rsquo;t decided which back he was going to go with. When asked by a pool reporter how he felt about his playoff hopes resting on the shoulders of Matt Jones, Ian smiled coyly and replied, &ldquo;Or Alfred Morris, hmm?&rdquo; Ian ended up going with Jones after all, and boy howdy, is it a good thing he did. It turns out, that decision was going to make or break the Falcons&rsquo; season. Jones eclipsed 50 all-purpose yards&mdash;and the Falcons thus eclipsed Jesus&mdash;at the 12:07 mark in the fourth quarter.<br>
    <br>
    Alfred Morris would finish the game with 12 total yards.<br>
    <br>
    A week ago, Morris had 23 carries for 78 yards, while Jones had just eight carries for 19 yards. So how did Ian have the balls to go with Jones in the most critical moment of his season? &ldquo;Instinct,&rdquo; says Ian. &ldquo;Instinct harvested from so many years of playing competitive football at a high level myself.&rdquo; (Remember, Ian played for KU <em>before</em> it would have been laughable to say their program played &ldquo;at a high level.&rdquo;)<br>
    <div class="news-quote">[It&rsquo;s] instinct harvested from so many years of playing competitive football at a high level myself.<div class="author">Ian</div></div>
    <br>
    So the Falcons made good on their end of the bargain, putting the pressure on the Bensons to win their own game to keep their season alive. And that&rsquo;s when the drama reached critical mass. An 11 on a scale of one to 10. Threat Level Midnight. Whatever. It was intense.<br>
    <br>
    Thirteen weeks of JADDL football boiled down to a simple battle in the waning moments of the regular season: The People of Bad News Nation vs. Dez Bryant. And for oh so long, that battle looked like it was going to go Bad News&rsquo; way, thrilling the Overland Park community so soon after they had reveled in a World Series championship. The first quarter went by without a single catch by Bryant. The game reached halftime, and still Bryant was blanked. Surely the Cowboys would make adjustments at the break and start getting the ball to their best player, right? Not so much &hellip; Bryant was kept off the fantasy scoreboard for a third quarter of play, astonishingly. Bensons fans began making plans to erect a Matt Cassel statue in the heart of Johnson County.<br>
    <br>
    Minutes began falling off the clock in the fourth quarter. Still no receptions. The 5.8-point margin that seemed so slight when the game began, suddenly seemed like an embarrassing thing to be nervous about. People started flocking to bars so they could be around other fans when the celebration began. Making the playoffs! Keeping their hated rivals <em>out</em> of the playoffs! It all seemed too good to be true.<br>
    <br>
    Then, with 6:43 left in the game, Bryant had his first catch. Just one catch &hellip; but it was for 42 yards. At the snap of a finger, that 5.8-point lead deflated to 1.6. Hands went up to heads. Nails began getting chewed. And still, the drama was only just beginning.<br>
    <br>
    With just 1:56 remaining, Bryant caught his second pass of the game, for 12 yards. The Bensons&rsquo; lead was down to a microscopic 0.4. Only, it actually wasn&rsquo;t. The play was reviewed, and the result was reversed; no catch, no points for Bryant, a temporary reprieve for Bad News Nation. Nine seconds later, the Cowboys would punt. The (NFL) game was tied, and there was less than two minutes left, so surely the Redskins would be conservative deep in their own territory, with little dinks and dunks to get into field goal range. Or they could be <em>ultra</em> conservative and play for overtime, which would be a sliver of hope for the Falcons; potentially more chances for Bryant receptions. But they never got that chance. DeSean Jackson, noted moron, engaged Hero Mode, ran back and forth across the field on the punt return, trying to make something amazing happen &hellip;<br>
    <br>
    &hellip; And fumbled the ball back to the Cowboys.<br>
    <br>
    This <em>should</em> have been the death knell for the Falcons. The Cowboys, already well within field goal range, would run the ball three times, wind the clock down, kick the game-winner, and send Bensons fans into a euphoric frenzy. Naturally, the Cowboys instead did Cowboy things, and scored a rushing touchdown on their second play, taking only 12 seconds off the clock. Okay, thought panicky Bensons fans, no problem, the game is still going to end with the Redskins&rsquo; desperation attempts. No more opportunities for Bryant, right? <em>Right?!</em><br>
    <br>
    Well, the Cowboys weren&rsquo;t done doing Cowboy things. They were flagged for a facemask penalty on the kickoff return, giving the Redskins incredible starting field position. Then, four plays and thirty seconds later, they inexplicably let DeSean Jackson get behind them for a long touchdown. Tie game, yet again. Overtime a possibility, yet again. The Falcons with a pulse, yet again. Bensons fans on the verge of a collective heart attack, yet again. But overtime never came. What <em>did</em> come, on the ensuing Cowboys possession?<br>
    <br>
    Back-to-back Dez Bryant catches, totaling 20 yards. Two fantasy points. And a playoff spot for the Millennium Falcons.<br>
    <br>
    The final catch, the one that propelled the Falcons past Jesus and flipped Alex&rsquo;s calendar to the off-season, came with 21 seconds left in Week 13.<br>
    <br>
    21 seconds left in the JADDL regular season.<br>
    <br>
    These are the storylines fantasy football was made for. It isn&rsquo;t about the money. It isn&rsquo;t just about the glory, or the competition, and it certainly isn&rsquo;t about the football. It&rsquo;s about the stories we create and share with our little virtual dudes on an imaginary playing field with our very real friends&mdash;and, in this case, family. This wasn&rsquo;t another chapter in the Family Feud rivalry, exactly. The Falcons and Bensons didn&rsquo;t play each other. But it may as well have been. Because this night, these games, and those 21 fateful seconds, will be talked about long after most Falcons-Bensons games fade deep into the archives.<br>
    <br>
    Here&rsquo;s to the Falcons, the veritable phoenixes of the East. And here&rsquo;s to JADDL football. Isn&rsquo;t it wonderful?
