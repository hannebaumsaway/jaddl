    Well, that didn&rsquo;t tell us much about the superiority of either division, now did it?<br/>
    <br/>
    After one week of interdivision play, the board stands at three wins for the West, and three for the East. Lame. There wasn&rsquo;t even much in terms of storylines. But we&rsquo;re professional here at the JADDL News Service, so let&rsquo;s try to at least point some things out that you might have missed.<br/>
    <br/>
    Perhaps the biggest surprise of the weekend was Team Hauloll. They bucked #TheCurse long enough to shake the 0-13 albatross off their shoulders when they took down traditional East power The Mighty Boom. Of course, this may not be your father&rsquo;s Mighty Boom team, either: Boom has averaged just 69.9 points per game in its last three outings, including this 82.2&ndash;72.8 loss to previously winless Hauloll. And just like that, another #0and13Watch has ended. We may never realize the dream.<br/>

    In Pursuit of Perfection, LLC, continued its <em>actual</em> pursuit of perfection when it drubbed freefalling Lawrence Football Jesus by 48. En route, IPP has racked up three straight Briefly Badasses for their mantle, becoming the first team in JADDL history to accomplish that feat. The Longshanks won four of them in a five-week span, but no team has ever won three consecutive. Good on ya, Nomac.<br/>

    Finally, Riley County Comfort survived a nail-biter against the Millennium Falcons when Millennium running back Rashad Jennings fell just short of overcoming Comfort tight end Larry Donnell on Monday night. That&rsquo;s what makes fantasy football so great: months of preparation and weeks of roster management, and you&rsquo;re left with your game coming down to a virtual head-to-head match-up between Rashad Jennings and Larry Donnell.<br/>
    <br/>
    The East collectively outscored the West 574.9 to 551.9, in case you were curious. Beyond that, we&rsquo;ll have to wait for round two before we start to draw any conclusions about this year&rsquo;s edition of the Chasm War.
