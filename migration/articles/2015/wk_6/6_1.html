    There was a time when certain things were said about the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks&rsquo; 2015 roster. Things like, &ldquo;This team is bad, folks, real bad,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;The scary thing is, [this team] might be worse than either [the 2011 or 2012 Shanks],&rdquo; and, &ldquo;[IPA Connoisseur] isn&rsquo;t Ryan Hannebaum bad.&rdquo;<br/>
    <br/>
    Of course, <a href="http://jaddl.tumblr.com/post/129642186832/week-2-power-rankings" target="_blank">it was the same person who said all those things</a>: James Jordan, owner and general manager of the now 2-4 Lawrence Football Jesus franchise. James isn&rsquo;t talking nearly as much these days as he was a few weeks ago, and the Longshanks don&rsquo;t really resemble the 0-2 squad he was talking about at the time, either.<br/>
    <br/>
    At the time, the Shanks averaged just 61.4 points per game. Really terrible. Even 2007 Football Jesus&mdash;widely acknowledged as the worst team in JADDL history&mdash;averaged more in its first two weeks, with 73.5. Peyton Manning suddenly looked 105 years old. LeGarrette Blount was taking a back seat to Dion Lewis because Bill Belichick. Martavis Bryant was still two weeks away from his return from suspension. Tony Romo broke again. On and on the problems went, up and down the Longshanks&rsquo; roster.<br/>
    <div class="news-quote">0-13 looked like a real, honest-to-god possibility [after Week 2]. 3-3 looked absurd by comparison.</div>
    <br/>
    0-13 looked like a real, honest-to-god possibility at that point. 3-3 looked absurd by comparison.<br/>
    <br/>
    Well, here they sit at 3-3 nonetheless, after resuming their customary domination of the West with a 101.0&ndash;66.3 thumping of the defending champion (boy, isn&rsquo;t that title fading fast) Angry Monkeys.<br/>
    <br/>
    Maybe it had nothing to do with this recent surge, but after Week 2, in the depths of his despair, Ryan made the executive decision to bring his franchise&rsquo;s look back to its roots: green. If you&rsquo;ll recall, the Longshanks didn&rsquo;t use blue accents on their famous all-white uniforms until 2010&hellip;and they haven&rsquo;t really won anything since. So Ryan busted out a new green logo that harkened back the logo of yesteryear, along with green-accented unis to boot. Does shit like that matter? Ask fans of the Flying Pigs&mdash;er, Angry Monkeys.<br/>
    <br/>
    The last several weeks have painted a somewhat rosier picture for the Shanks. It&rsquo;s not <em>all</em> roses, but at least it&rsquo;s not all weeds, either. Over the past four weeks, the Shanks have averaged 94.3 points per game, good for third best in the division over that time. Former no-show LeGarrette Blount (has anyone had a more fitting name?) has averaged 19 in his last three outings. Tight end Greg Olsen&mdash;of whom much was expected going into the year&mdash;is still hot and cold, but his hot has finally been more than tepid, having scored over 19 in two of his last three games. Demaryius Thomas, while shackled by the shittiness of Peyton Manning to some extent, has been Steady Eddie with around 10 guaranteed points each time out. Matt Forte has been the Demaryius Thomas of the running back corps; nothing flashy, just steady production.<br/>
    <br/>
    And now it looks like Martavis Bryant might repeat his 2014 performance with or without Big Ben, after he put up nearly 30 in his season debut&hellip;and that&rsquo;s with Landry Jones throwing to him.<br/>
    <br/>
    Is this team perfect? Fuck no. Is it even good? Meh&hellip;they&rsquo;re still aspiring to be solid at this stage. But being within reach of <em>solid</em> at the midway point is a huge accomplishment considering where the Shanks started. There are still plenty of holes on the roster&mdash;the quarterback position is still a shit-show&mdash;but now there are viable pieces Ryan can work with, too.<br/>
    <br/>
    And this is the right time for the Shanks to have a semi-competent roster. Need I remind you? It&rsquo;s interdivision time. And the Longshanks love nothing more than playing across the Chasm against Western foes. They&rsquo;ve now won seven straight interdivision games. <em>Seven straight.</em> And we&rsquo;re talking about a team which hasn&rsquo;t had a winning record overall in that timespan. Over those seven games, the Shanks have averaged a whopping 115 points per. Yes, I&rsquo;d say the Shanks get &ldquo;up&rdquo; to play in the Chasm War.<br/>
    <br/>
    The real key now, after completing a couple more wins over Western opponents, is to <em>stay</em> up when division play starts back up again. That&rsquo;s been the Shanks&rsquo; bugaboo, and one they must shake if they want any hope of breaking this tragically long playoff drought.
