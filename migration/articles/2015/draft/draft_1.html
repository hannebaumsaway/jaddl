    His name is Mark Bloom, but you can call him <i>Dr. Roto</i>. He&rsquo;s an expert in his field, and his field just so happens to be fantasy sports. He&rsquo;s a senior fantasy sports analyst for Scout, where you can watch him on Scout Fantasy TV. You can also hear him daily on SiriusXM Fantasy Sports Radio (channel 87).<br/>
    <br/>
    In 2014, Dr. Roto gave 500 contestants a chance to take him down a peg in his Beat Dr. Roto contest. None of them succeeded. Back in 2011, he won the Fantasy Sports Writers Association&rsquo;s Newcomer of the Year award&mdash;yes, that&rsquo;s a thing. He&rsquo;s won a ton of leagues throughout the years, has been playing fantasy sports since the 1990s, and is simply way too good to be grading the JADDL Draft.<br/>
    <br/>
    Yet here he is, grading the 2015 JADDL Draft. Dr. Roto was gracious enough to give us his two best and two worst selections, as well as name a winner of the Torn Hoodie.<br/>

    Palmer and Mariota? Really?? Julius Thomas being out for a month hurts too. Oh, and T.Y. and Gurley are injured, too. This would be a great team &hellip; in a dynasty keeper league &hellip; but not this year.<br/>

    I love <i>Star Wars</i>, but I think that this team might be facing the Dark Side&mdash;VJax, Colston, and Fred?? Old is not good. Alf Morris might lose his job too at some point, and [Ian] does not own Matt Jones. He will need The Force to survive this year.<br/>

    Calvin, Cooks, and Andre to go with Big Ben is a great start. If Arian comes back quickly, and if Cameron Artis-Payne gets the starting running back job, [Adam] will be someone I do not want to see in the playoffs.<br/>

    	The Mighty Boom <img src="assets/images/trophies/trophy-hoodie.png" />

    Looks like Boom is going to dominate this season. I love Dez, Julio Jones Roto, and Allen Robinson. His WRs are VISIONARY!! He has Murray, Ivory, and Abdullah too. He needs a TE when Gates comes back, but otherwise he looks tough to beat. Boom is my pick for the best draft.
