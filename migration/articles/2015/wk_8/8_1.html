    In 2010, IPA Connoisseur&mdash;then known as the IPA Guzzlers; a much grosser, less inspiring name&mdash;went 3-10 and finished dead last in the brand new West Division. So you may not have seen what was to come over the following four years.<br>
    <br>
    Four straight playoff berths. Three straight semifinal appearances. Two Jared&rsquo;s Goblets. And a partridge in a pear tree.<br>
    <br>
    By now, IPA fans have come to expect success. They&rsquo;ve forgotten 2010. They now bask in Lannie&rsquo;s brash confidence and wear his public bravado like a collective badge of honor for the entirety of Connoisseur Nation, instead of shying away from it apologetically like years past.<br>
    <br>
    And luckily for those cocky fans, Team Hauloll started the year 0-5 and sucked up any negative attention the media was shooting westward, because quietly, meekly, IPA had started 0-4 itself. Through that point in the season, Connoisseur were outscoring only Team Odouls in the entire league. Lannie was playing a losing game of Pong with his struggling quarterbacks, Drew Brees and Famous Jameis Winston. I&rsquo;d point out the things that were going well for IPA at that point, if there were any.<br>
    <div class="news-quote">We noticed the empty seats in our stands.<div class="author">Lannie</div></div>
    <br>
    When 0-4 Hauloll traveled to take on 0-4 IPA in Week 5, in one of the least anticipated JADDL matchups in recent memory, fan morale was, suffice it to say, low. And the fans themselves were beginning to become sparse. Fickle beasts, fans. &ldquo;We noticed the empty seats in our stands, I won&rsquo;t say we didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Lannie would say following the game.<br>
    <br>
    But then something funny happened: that game was actually a good one. The fans that did show up to support IPA were rewarded, as their team refused to be the ones bearing #0and13Watch onward. They scratched and clawed and fought and crawled their way to a four point victory over then-cursed Hauloll, breaking the 100 barrier for the first time all year, and giving fans something that amounted to a giant sigh of relief. Maybe they wouldn&rsquo;t win another Goblet this year, but they sure as shit wouldn&rsquo;t finish 0-13, and maybe&mdash;just maybe&mdash;they still had a shot at the postseason.<br>
    <br>
    Then came Week 6, and interdivision play along with it&mdash;an endeavor in which IPA had gone 5-1 in the previous two seasons. Nonetheless, Week 6 acted as the proverbial bucket of ice water this time around. IPA&rsquo;s score was back in the 70s in a lopsided loss to the Bad News Bensons. Shockingly, 1-5 coming off a loss looks exponentially worse to fans than 1-4 coming off a win.<br>
    <br>
    But IPA would recover and take care of business against the worst team the East has to offer, in the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks.<br>
    <br>
    Now Connoisseur entered the final week of interdivision play with its season truly on the brink against (probably) the second worst team in the East, Team Odouls. Fall to 2-6, and IPA could kiss the playoffs good-bye. Literally zero teams in JADDL history (unless my data mining skills have gotten rusty) have bounced back from 2-6 to make the playoffs. Get to 3-5, though, and you&rsquo;re Lloyd Christmas with a chance. Not a great one, mind you&mdash;out of 18 teams that have been 3-5 after eight weeks, two went on to play in the postseason&mdash;but the path has been paved. The Mighty Boom even made it all the way to the Jared Bowl in 2011 after sitting at 3-5 with five weeks to play.<br>
    <br>
    So this game against Odouls was a big one for IPA, relatively speaking. Odouls was trying to climb back to .500 after its most impressive performance of the year, ending In Pursuit of Perfection&rsquo;s pursuit of perfection. And Odouls came to play this week, putting up exactly 100 and effectively telling IPA, <em>Your move, hot shot.</em><br>
    <br>
    IPA accepted the challenge, and crushed it, thanks in large part to Drew Brees. You see, good things tend to happen when your quarterback scores nearly half a hundred (46.3, to be exact) by himself. Awesome things tend to happen when a receiver&mdash;in this case, Odell Beckham Jr.&mdash;tacks on 33 of his own. You can survive things like getting zero from your Flex (John Brown) when these other awesome things happen.<br>
    <br>
    And Connoisseur not only survived; they thrived, to the tune of a 134.8&ndash;100.0 statement win.<br>
    <br>
    Season: alive. But the climb: uphill.
