    James knew he would have to survive these first two weeks of the season. He was playing the long game when he drafted Le&rsquo;Veon Bell number one overall back in August, considering Bell&rsquo;s two-game suspension. But James wasn&rsquo;t deterred from drafting the guy he deemed the best player in the league. He had enough faith in his abilities as a general manager to trust he could craft a team around Bell which could weather the suspension.<br/>
    <br/>
    James? Faith in his GM abilities? Really?<br/>
    <br/>
    Yes, really. Over the first five years of the JADDL, Lawrence Football Jesus&mdash;or D.C. Football Obama, briefly&mdash;averaged 1,005 points per season. That was good, naturally, for dead last in the league. By a lot.<br/>
    <br/>
    But from 2012 to 2014, Jesus upped that average to 1,175. That number is eighth best over that span (all four teams behind Jesus are from the West, coincidentally&hellip;ehhhrrrm). Is eighth best something to brag about? Maybe not, but it represents significant progress for a much-maligned franchise.<br/>
    <br/>
    That franchise is looking to parlay the number one overall pick into another big step forward this year. James had the top pick once before, if you&rsquo;ll recall: the infamous Michael Vick pick. But we&rsquo;ll have to wait one more week to begin evaluating how this pick is going to turn out.<br/>
    <br/>
    In the meantime, LFJ has been leaning on Bell&rsquo;s backup, DeAngelo Williams. That&rsquo;s right: the same DeAngelo Williams who tore the league up en route to a Jared Bowl II MVP performance&hellip;seven years ago. Williams is 32 years old now, but apparently he&rsquo;s still got it. Instead of James counting down the days until Bell&rsquo;s return, he&rsquo;s been tallying up the points Williams has been piling up&mdash;40.4 of them, in total.<br/>
    <br/>
    That includes 27.2 in his last outing against the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks, a dominant 113.7&ndash;65.4 victory for Jesus. When Williams ran for 127 yards in Week 1 and scored 13 points, people acknowledged the good fortune for Jesus, despite an eventual loss. Now, people are actually discussing whether the Steelers&mdash;and James&mdash;should consider giving Williams the starting nod <em>over</em> Bell in Week 3, to ride the hot hand. I&rsquo;m serious; people are actually debating that.<br/>
    <br/>
    But James is not. Before the stadium lights had even cooled off late Monday night, James made the switch on his depth chart. It will be Le&rsquo;Veon Bell trotting onto the field when LFJ takes on the Millennium Falcons. Bell will carry lofty expectations on his shoulders, those of a savior&hellip;but Football Jesus may not need &ldquo;saving&rdquo; after all. Their roster is balanced, as <a href="http://jaddl.tumblr.com/post/129642186832/week-2-power-rankings" target="_blank">James himself observes in his DDL post</a>.<br/>
    <div class="news-quote">I love this team. I&rsquo;m just going to enjoy this.<div class="author">James on The DDL</div></div>
    <br/>
    It&rsquo;s balanced, and potent. Through the first two weeks, Football Jesus leads the entire league in points scored. They have a top five quarterback in Aaron Rodgers; a top five receiver in Julian Edelman; a top five tight end in Jason Witten (though we&rsquo;ll have to see what the Tony Romo injury does to his production).<br/>
    <br/>
    They also have the top running back in the league so far. And it&rsquo;s not Le&rsquo;Veon Bell.<br/>
    <br/>
    &hellip;Yet.
