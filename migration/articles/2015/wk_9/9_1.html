    It&rsquo;s always fun, when I sit down to write an article, to look back at the articles I wrote about the featured team in previous years.<br>
    <br>
    Except when the featured team is The Mighty Boom. Then it&rsquo;s really boring. Because every article is the same. Every year seems to be the same. <em>Hey everyone, look! Boom is in first place again! Can you believe it?</em><br>
    <br>
    Of course they can fucking believe it. Since the start of the divisional era, Boom has spent 31 weeks at the top of the East Division in the standings. 31 weeks! That&rsquo;s out of 74 weeks total. So if you were to lay out all the East leaders of each regular season week of the past six seasons, including what&rsquo;s been played in 2015 so far, on a roulette wheel and give &rsquo;er a spin, you&rsquo;d have a 42% chance of landing on The Mighty Boom. I mean, what the hell. George Clooney would barely have those odds of picking up a random middle-aged woman at a neighborhood bar.<br>
    <br>
    So let&rsquo;s go ahead and consult the articles of JADDL past. In 2014, I wrote, &ldquo;Boom. Will. Not. Go. Away.&rdquo; In 2013: &ldquo;For Peter, I&rsquo;m sure this never, ever gets old. For everyone else, Boom&rsquo;s winning ways wore out their welcome years ago.&rdquo; It also appears that I did this <em>trip-down-memory-lane</em> thing in 2013, so I&rsquo;ll go ahead and stop it now.<br>
    <div class="news-quote">How many different ways can I talk about how awesome Peter is at fantasy football?</div>
    <br>
    But that&rsquo;s what Peter has reduced me to: repeating my literary devices, because he won&rsquo;t stop repeating his dominance. Boom is a beat writer&rsquo;s worst nightmare. How many different ways can I talk about how awesome Peter is at fantasy football? (At least in the regular season&hellip;)<br>
    <br>
    That&rsquo;s dull. So let&rsquo;s shake it up a bit and look at Boom&rsquo;s record (6-3, 5-1 in the East) from a different perspective. Let&rsquo;s look at the kind of competition Boom is facing. Are they taking on everyone else&rsquo;s A-game week in and week out, or are opponents wilting in Boom&rsquo;s shadow, succumbing to intimidation?<br>
    <br>
    The latter, at least this year. Boom is at the very bottom of the chart when it comes to Points Against across the entire league. That&rsquo;s quite helpful when it comes to wins and losses, I&rsquo;m sure Pete would agree. But let&rsquo;s look historically, as you know I like to do. The whole picture isn&rsquo;t any more flattering for Boom than 2015 alone. The only active team in the JADDL which has had less points scored against it all-time is the Millennium Falcons, and that&rsquo;s only because the Falcons have played 26 fewer regular season games than Boom. When you look at average points against, Boom is appropriately at the very bottom.<br>
    <br>
    However, don&rsquo;t go shoving these stats in the faces of all the Boom fans you know just yet.<br>
    <br>
    You see, Boom has the least points scored against them primarily because they don&rsquo;t have to play <em>against themselves.</em> Strength-of-schedule arguments only really hold water when the team in question isn&rsquo;t putting up impressive enough numbers in its own right. That isn&rsquo;t the case with Boom, at all. In fact, Boom has the highest all-time scoring average in the league, 95.7. The league-wide average is 89.8.<br>
    <br>
    So yeah; you can poo-poo Boom&rsquo;s dominance with talking points about weak scheduling if you wish, but just be prepared for Boom Nation to give you a fucking statistics facial if you do.<br>
    <br>
    Oh, by the way: Boom defeated the Falcons 107.8&ndash;80.8 this past weekend, in case you were wondering. And this may turn out to be the high point of 2015 for The Mighty, seeing as how they have the second lowest scoring average in the league since Week 4, ahead of only the same Falcons they just beat. But that&rsquo;s fantasy football for you: you don&rsquo;t have to apologize for how your opponents play when you play them. And Peter isn&rsquo;t <em>about</em> to apologize to you assholes.
