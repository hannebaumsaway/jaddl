    There are two sides to a coin. A silver lining around every cloud. A potential treasure hunt within a nondescript pile of garbage.<br/>
    <br/>
    And for every victim of #TheCurse, there are #TheBlessed. That&rsquo;s the part of the saga rarely talked about, but often felt. Take the latest iteration of #TheCurse, for instance: the one haunting Team Hauloll up and down the imaginary field. Part of Hauloll&rsquo;s misfortune this season, <a href="index.php?view=news&yr=2015&wk=3&pg=2">as we discussed</a>, was the fall of Tevin Coleman. That doesn&rsquo;t seem like such a big deal on the surface&mdash;certainly not Curse-worthy on its own&mdash;until you look deeper. Do that, and you&rsquo;ll discover that Coleman went down a week before Hauloll had to play In Pursuit of Perfection, LLC&hellip;the same In Pursuit of Perfection that drafted one Devonta (<a href="https://twitter.com/fifthreichpicks/status/650826084305510400" target="_blank">or Devanto, or DeVonatoas</a>) Freeman, just two picks <em>after</em> Hauloll took Tevin Coleman.<br/>
    <br/>
    Coleman&rsquo;s injury freed up Freeman to get all of Matt Ryan&rsquo;s handoffs.<br/>
    <br/>
    In Freeman stepped to IPP&rsquo;s starting lineup, replacing Bishop Sankey, and all Freeman did in response was roll to 37.3 points. IPP would need most of them, too, as its D/ST&mdash;the Dolphins&mdash;took away seven points on the other end of the spectrum. IPP survived that scar thanks to Freeman, and took Hauloll down 115.8&ndash;98.1.<br/>
    <br/>
    People around the league speculated: was Freeman a one-hit wonder? As it turns out, no; he was not.<br/>
    <div class="news-quote">When Jason chose Tevin Coleman, we exhaled. We totally knew it was going to work out this way, you guys.<div class="author">Nolan</div></div>
    <br/>
    He didn&rsquo;t <em>quite</em> match his Week 3 total, but Freeman came closer than anyone could have expected when he scored 32.9 this past weekend in a 104.7&ndash;78.7 victory over The IPA Connoisseur. That&rsquo;s right: in his first two weeks as a starting running back in the JADDL, Devonta Freeman racked up 70.2 combined points. Is that a league record for a player in his first two games? It has to be, right? Does someone want to look that up? Because I&rsquo;m not going to. I&rsquo;m just going to assume.<br/>
    <br/>
    &hellip;Were those even Devonta Freeman&rsquo;s first two games? Hell, I don&rsquo;t know. Maybe he played for someone last year, but I don&rsquo;t remember him.<br/>
    <br/>
    I&rsquo;ll remember him now, certainly.<br/>
    <br/>
    &ldquo;This is why we took a chance on him in the seventh round,&rdquo; Nolan said following the game. &ldquo;We targeted him. We hoped he&rsquo;d still be there for us to take. When Jason chose Tevin Coleman, we exhaled. We totally knew it was going to work out this way, you guys.&rdquo;<br/>
    <br/>
    Sure. But IPP is more than just Devonta Freeman. They&rsquo;ve got that sasquatch who pretends to be a tight end for five months a year, named Gronk. He&rsquo;s once again the top TE in the league, averaging a ridiculous 18 points per game. The second highest average is Travis Kelce&hellip;with merely 11. The scary thing for the rest of the West is that IPP is 4-0, and Gronk and his Pursuit battery mate&mdash;Tom Brady&mdash;have already had their bye week. Oh, by the way, Brady has the highest average of any quarterback in the league thus far, too. Yes, higher even than Lawrence Football Jesus&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dd7FixvoKBw" target="_blank">A.A.Ron</a> Rodgers.<br/>
    <br/>
    This team is so good right now that guys like AJ Green and Chris Ivory&mdash;who Nolan got in a seemingly brilliant trade with The Mighty Boom for Russell Wilson&mdash;are almost afterthoughts&hellip;until they burn you.<br/>
    <br/>
    This early goodness is uncharted territory for Pursuit. Their best previous start after four weeks was a 2-1-1 mark way back in 2007, and before this season they&rsquo;d started 2-2 in six consecutive seasons. &ldquo;Consistency is key,&rdquo; Nolan remarked when asked about that streak. As for points scored to date, it isn&rsquo;t even close historically. IPP&rsquo;s 424.2 easily eclipsed the 382.2 scored through four games in 2013, its previous high water mark.<br/>
    <br/>
    The question now is, how will Nolan and his team handle success? Will the spotlight blind them, or will they revel in its warm glow?<br/>
    <br/>
    A Week 5 showdown with the (current) second best team in the West, Riley County Comfort, may go a long way toward an answer.
