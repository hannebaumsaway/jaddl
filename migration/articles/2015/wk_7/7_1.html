    People have been saying it for years, and it may just be true: fantasy football GMs may actually know better than NFL GMs.<br>
    <br>
    The latest example comes from the Phoenix area, where Team Hauloll continues to shake off the effects of #TheCurse felt in the beginning of the season. After losing its first five games out of the shoot, Hauloll has now won back-to-back games for the first time since Week 11 of 2014.<br>
    <br>
    The general management superiority I speak of? That would center around one Lamar Miller. Hauloll GM Jason Landoll, crown prince of Marysville, has been saying since back when Miller was a member of the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks that he was being under- and ill-used by his NFL coaching staff, primarily former head coach Joe Philbin. Landoll remained convinced that Miller had star potential when he drafted him in the second round.<br>
    <br>
    Early on, the returns were not good on that investment, and Landoll&rsquo;s vitriol toward Philbin grew. And it grew.<br>
    <div class="news-quote">We weren&rsquo;t cursed. We were Philbin&rsquo;d.<div class="author">Jason</div></div>
    <br>
    In Week 4, Miller had his worst outing yet as a member of Team Hauloll, scoring just 3.6 in a loss&mdash;Hauloll&rsquo;s fourth straight&mdash;to the Red Hornets. At one point in the game, Miller was being out-gained by quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick. Fitzpatrick may have a glorious beard, but he doesn&rsquo;t have gloriously fleet feet, and the situation was <em>finally</em> bad enough to get Joe Philbin fired. &ldquo;Our franchise is pleased,&rdquo; Hauloll headquarters stated in response to the firing.<br>
    <br>
    The question then became, was Philbin the villain in this saga, truly? The answer seems to be: yes, as a matter of fact, he was.<br>
    <br>
    After a bye, Miller made his first Philbin-less appearance for Hauloll when they faced off in interdivision play against The Mighty Boom in Week 6. Miller ran like a new man, gaining 113 yards on 19 carries and adding a touchdown, for 17.8 points, leading Hauloll to its first when of the year and putting an end to #0and13Watch for another season. &ldquo;Did you really just ask me if it was important to get Lamar going?&rdquo; Landoll replied incredulously to a reporter&rsquo;s question following Hauloll&rsquo;s 124.5&ndash;94.0 victory over The Bad News Bensons. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re 2-5. It&rsquo;s safe to say we need all the points and wins we can get. That&rsquo;s the bad news. The good news is, it appears we weren&rsquo;t cursed. We were Philbin&rsquo;d.&rdquo;<br>
    <br>
    Instead of regressing back to his recent norm&mdash;or at least, his norm under Joe Philbin&mdash;Miller poured a lot more gasoline on the fantasy-GMs-are-the-better-GMs fire in Week 7, slicing and dicing his way to an eye-opening 39.6 points. Miller&rsquo;s previous career high was 25.8, way back in the first week of 2014.<br>
    <br>
    Yes, fantasy GMs, pundits, and fans saw Miller&rsquo;s potential long before anyone in the <em>real world</em> did, and Miller&rsquo;s performances these past two weeks have felt somewhat akin to justice for the fantasy football community as a whole.<br>
    <br>
    It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before an NFL franchise fills its GM vacancy with a 24-year-old stats nerd because of his experience running a fantasy football team.
