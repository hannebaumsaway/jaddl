	Don&rsquo;t look now, but the One Pump Chumps are still winning. In Week 5. Of the current season.<br><br>	Anyone who knows OPC owner Jesse knows he likes to talk about &ldquo;returning to the championship.&rdquo; Anyone who speaks English knows that to return to something, you have to have been there before. Thus, it stands to reason that Jesse is under the impression that his Chumps have indeed been to the &rsquo;ship. What&rsquo;s more: he thinks they won the whole fuckin&rsquo; thing (thank you Tom Berenger).<br><br>	But when was this magical year? According to Jesse, it was 2003 A.D. In the fantasy football world, that&rsquo;s practically the leather helmet era. Before live scoring, weekly newsletters, fractional points&hellip;hell, before the JADDL itself.<br>	<div class='news-quote'>Back in 2003&hellip;<div class='author'>Jesse, One Pump Chumps owner</div></div><br>	Let&rsquo;s put 2003 into perspective, shall we? In 2003, a guy by the name of Priest was the best RB in the NFL. The Kansas City Royals actually led the AL Central at the All-Star Break. Quarterbacks Kurt Warner and Brett Favre were still playing&hellip;okay, so some things don&rsquo;t change.<br><br>	The point is, we&rsquo;ve been hearing for over half a decade (45 years in fantasy footballese) about that one time when the One Pump Chumps won it all, but this story is usually met with a polite smile and nod, and then a &ldquo;bullshit&rdquo; muttered under one&rsquo;s breath while walking away. If OPC is able to pull off the improbable championship run this year&mdash;they currently sit at 4-1 after a solid 116.9 &mdash; 101.8 win over The IPA Guzzlers&mdash;we won&rsquo;t have to hear about the year two thousand freaking five ever again. It would be a glorious day for JADDL fans across the country. Oh, and it&rsquo;d be nice for Jesse and the Chumps as well.<br><br>	&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we play for every year, the championship,&rdquo; said Jesse. &ldquo;Back in 2003 when&hellip;&rdquo;<br><br>	Oh, hell.
