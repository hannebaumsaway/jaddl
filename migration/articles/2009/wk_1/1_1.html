	Congress has some work to do. DC Football Obama&rsquo;s health is in need of serious care after the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks came to town and declared a mandate on their asses, 126.8 - 60.3.<br><br>	The &rsquo;Shanks were led by QB Tony Romo, who looked like a man with something to prove in the second half of the game en route to 32.2 points, second among all quarterbacks in Week 1. Romo&rsquo;s inspiration may not be hard to discern: rumors abound that Jessica Simpson was in attendance at the game, sporting Football Obama gear and hanging onto the arm of another man. When asked on Monday if she was indeed at the game to watch Romo, Simpson replied, &ldquo;Romo? More like homo.&rdquo;<br><br>	Romo&rsquo;s response to that? &ldquo;Simpson? More like stupid whore.&rdquo;<br><br>	Aside from Romo being Simpson-less, there was plenty this weekend for Longshanks fans to get excited about. Showing that he hasn&rsquo;t lost his touch after last year&rsquo;s title run, &rsquo;Shanks owner Ryan activated RB Willis McGahee just twenty minutes prior to kickoff, replacing Jonathan Stewart. McGahee thanked him by piling up 19.5 points (Stewart scored 6.7 on the bench). WR Roy Williams may have silenced draft-day doubters with 16.6 points of his own.<br><br>	As for Obama, well, one game certainly doesn&rsquo;t make a season. However, it may put a damper on the high expectations many Obamanites had coming into the season after what was widely viewed as a strong draft. It&rsquo;s hard to win a game when your QB and top RB combine for just 15.3 points. Also, in a move on the other end of the spectrum from Ryan&rsquo;s McGahee call, Obama owner James replaced WR Devin Hester with RB LenDale White. Hester wasted 15 points on the bench. White? 3.3. There is bipartisan support across Lawrence this week for the notion that the White-for-Hester substitution was retarded. But, in the grand scheme of things, would a 54.8 point loss have felt much better than a 66.5 point one? C&rsquo;mon.<br><br>	&ldquo;I hope our fans can understand that this is a long season, and there are some things we can change to get better and progress as a team,&rdquo; said James of the Longshanks vetoing the crap out of his Obama squad. &ldquo;A Football Obama team that every middle-class citizen can be proud of, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re after. That&rsquo;s what would be good for America&mdash;Hope. Change.&rdquo;<br><br>	Well, here&rsquo;s hoping Obama has appointed a Czar of Not Sucking to address its problems before next week&rsquo;s spar with the One Pump Chumps, or it could be a long term&mdash;er, season&mdash;for Obama fans.
