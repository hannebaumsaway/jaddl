	Team Odouls is winning again. Yawn. They&rsquo;re in solid playoff position again. Yawn. They&rsquo;ve scored the most points in the league to this point, yet have underachieved record-wise&hellip;again.<br>	<br>	Yawn.<br>	<br>	But what Odouls RB Adrian Peterson does on the field is anything but boring. It&rsquo;s so un-boring, in fact, it&rsquo;s practically X-rated.<br>	<br>	Peterson&rsquo;s jukes and bursts of speed on the field are so electrifying, women in the crowd have a difficult time&hellip;uh&hellip;containing themselves. This phenomenon has become so prevalent that parents have become wary of bringing their children to Odouls games.<br>	<br>	Team owner Adam dismisses the orgy-like atmosphere as a financial detriment, however.<br>	<br>	&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t noticed a drop-off in ticket sales at all,&rdquo; said Adam. &ldquo;For any family that chooses to stay home, a throng of young women is chomping at the bit to take their seats. In fact, all this has done is created a more intimidating environment for our opponents. Sixty thousand screaming women&mdash;it&rsquo;s like a sorority convention on crack.&rdquo;<br>	<br>	Ticket revenue may not be a problem for Adam, but it&rsquo;s possible TV revenue may soon be. The Federal Communications Commission has expressed concerns about showing the Odouls &ldquo;O-Fest&rdquo; on the air.<br>	<br>	&ldquo;JADDL games are supposed to be family programming,&rdquo; said an FCC spokesperson. &ldquo;There is nothing familial about the disgusting sexuality displayed in that stadium every weekend.&rdquo;<br>	<br>	The FCC hasn&rsquo;t announced any planned action just yet, but the spokesperson wouldn&rsquo;t rule out the possibility of blacking out Odouls&rsquo; remaining home games.<br>	<br>	&ldquo;We will do whatever it takes to keep America safe from terrorism and sex.&rdquo;<br>	<br>	One thing is for sure: Adam won&rsquo;t be asking Peterson to tone down the moves anytime soon, seeing as how those moves have accounted for 16.4% of Odouls&rsquo; scoring to this point, or 19.1 points per game&mdash;behind only Chris Johnson and Maurice Jones-Drew among RBs in the league. That includes 22.3 points in a 139.7&ndash;65.1 clowning of the Millennium Falcons this past weekend.<br>	<br>	&ldquo;Adrian fuels our team,&rdquo; said Adam. &ldquo;If he happens to rev the engines of the housewives in Houston while he&rsquo;s at it, all the better. You should see the sales figures for our women&rsquo;s pink number 28 jerseys.&rdquo;
