	One thing is for sure in this screwed up world: it&rsquo;s good to be Tom Brady.<br><br>	Just hours before he laid waste to Team Hauloll&rsquo;s defense, Brady apparently enjoyed a lay of another kind.<br><br>	&ldquo;I owe my performance today to Gisele,&rdquo; Brady told reporters after the game. &ldquo;Before I left for the stadium, she pulled me back into the hotel room and did unspeakable things to me. Then she told me there would be more where that came from after the game if I put up four touchdowns.&rdquo;<br><br>	Brady must&rsquo;ve wanted to seal the deal, because he added a bonus fifth touchdown for good measure. Something tells us he didn&rsquo;t need that fifth TD, though. Gisele&rsquo;s hormones must be going insane, what with the pregnancy and all&mdash;oh, and being with Tom mother-fucking Brady. <i>So, you knocked up a hot actress and left her during the pregnancy? That&rsquo;s cool, knock me up too!</i><br><br>	Not that five touchdowns wouldn&rsquo;t be impressive in any weather, or a dome for that matter, but Brady&rsquo;s legend grows with the fact that this all happened in a driving snowstorm. That&rsquo;s right: it was freaking snowing in Scottsdale, Arizona. Don&rsquo;t bother trying to figure it out. In the immortal words of soon-to-be-ex-Colorado head coach Dan Hawkins: this ain&rsquo;t intramurals brother, this is JADDL football!<br>	<div class='news-quote'>Before I left for the stadium, she pulled me back into the hotel room and did unspeakable things to me.

Hauloll (4-2) continued its solid play, putting 122.8 on the board (their 625.1 total points are second in the league). On an average day from Tom Brady, that would have been enough. But Brady&rsquo;s 41.2-point explosion vaulted the Pigs to 135.2 points and its second win of the season, keeping remote playoff hopes alive for the time being. The game also marked Hauloll&rsquo;s first loss at home this season.<br><br>	&ldquo;I made my fortune caring for old people,&rdquo; commented Pigs owner Jacob, manager of the nation&rsquo;s most renowned retirement community. &ldquo;My charges include Kurt Warner and Brett Favre in the off-season. You know who my charges don&rsquo;t include? Tom mother-fucking Brady.&rdquo;<br><br>	It&rsquo;s as likely Jacob will be caring for Tom Brady anytime soon as it is Brady will be caring for any of his illegitimate children. But as long as he&rsquo;s, well, Tom Brady, no one will care. Not even his baby mamas.
