	Dan aims to become the first 3-time champion in JADDL history. He nabbed his first Limousine in 2004. The Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks also won two titles recently, winning in &rsquo;05 and &rsquo;08. One of the champions that split up the Longshanks&rsquo; crowns?<br><br>	Romans&rsquo; Red Hornets.<br><br>	The rosy little insects have got serious sting again in 2009, averaging 99.8 points per outing. That isn&rsquo;t tops in the league&mdash;The Mighty Boom, Team Odouls, and Team Hauloll all score more (that&rsquo;s what she said)&mdash;but it&rsquo;s been enough to get the &rsquo;Nets to 7-1 and first place.<br><br>	The Buzzing Gingers are led by RB Maurice Jones-Drew, who put up 33.3 points in a 104.9 &mdash; 85.5 trouncing of In Pursuit of Perfection, LLC this past weekend. It&rsquo;s fitting Jones-Drew plays for the Hornets, as he&rsquo;s bug-sized himself. But he&rsquo;s shifty as hell, a staple on John Madden&rsquo;s All Players-With-Three-Names Team. And though he may be small in stature, one of his body parts is not.<br><br>	&hellip;His heart.<br><br>	&ldquo;Oh yeah, it&rsquo;s freaking huge,&rdquo; said Dan. &ldquo;I go down to the locker room after some games, and I&rsquo;ve seen it. His heart. It&rsquo;s enormous.&rdquo;<br><br>	Teammates agree with Romans&rsquo; assessment of Jones-Drew&rsquo;s most valuable organ.<br><br>	&ldquo;He&rsquo;s like a tripod,&rdquo; says Hornets QB Aaron &ldquo;Not Brett Favre&rdquo; Rodgers, &ldquo;with the legs of the tripod being his two arms and his heart. I&rsquo;m really jealous. I wish I could get my heart on like that.&rdquo;<br><br>	Reports are that someone else on the team is also jealous, to a level that could cause team dissention if not addressed soon.<br>	<div class='news-quote'>It&rsquo;s freaking huge.

His heart.<div class='author'>Dan, Red Hornets owner</div></div><br>	&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why people think MJD&rsquo;s is so big,&rdquo; whined teammate Terrell Owens. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all heart mother fucker! I gave a shorty my heart in a box last Christmas, and she <i>loved</i> it. Any of you punks question my heart, I&rsquo;ll slap you &rsquo;cross the face with it.&rdquo;<br><br>	Barring any serious heart-slapping fights in the clubhouse, though, this Hornets team is very much in the hunt for the Golden Limousine at this point. Dan, a high profile member of the Daywalker community, knows what implications his personal success could have on the sun-adverse population.<br><br>	&ldquo;I want to show my fair-skinned brethren that though we may fear UV rays, and though society generally fears us, we can still achieve anything we put our minds to. Well, except a tan.&rdquo;
