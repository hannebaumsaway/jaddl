<div id="headline">Jared Allen: right-wing nutjob?</div>
<div id="article">
	LAWRENCE, KS â€“ DC Football Obama owner James Jordan went to bed with a smile on his face and slept soundly on Sunday night. He dreamt of a world in which his fantasy football team wasn&rsquo;t completely hopeless. He was inspired to dream big by the fact that his team had finally just notched their first victory in the 2009 season.<br/>
<br/>
Or so he thought. He awoke Monday morning to a horrific shock:<br/>
<br/>
Team Odouls 104.6, DC Football Obama 104.5.<br/>
<br/>
<em>What the fuck?</em> thought Jordan. Where did Odouls&rsquo; extra points come from? All players on both teams were in the books.<br/>
<br/>
Jordan quickly contacted JADDL commissioner Ryan Hannebaum, who assured him he had nothing to do with the post-game adjustment (manual adjustments would show up on the league&rsquo;s activity log). Jordan narrowed down the change to Odouls RB Tim Hightower, who had 4 points on Sunday night, yet showed up with 6 the following morning, giving Odouls the slimmest victory possible: by a tenth of a point.<br/>
<br/>
How did Hightower score 2 points overnight? Or did he?<br/>
<br/>
Hightower&rsquo;s stats (9 rushing yards, 11 receiving yards, 1 TD, and 1 fumble) added up to 6 points&hellip;but where were they the night before? Mysteriously, video evidence of Hightower&rsquo;s performance cannot be located. But by dissecting the play-byplay, Jordan believes he&rsquo;s found the problem: in the fourth quarter of the Cardinals/Giants game, the footage cuts away to commercial during a Cardinals drive. When the game comes back on the air, the Giants have the ball, yet the Cardinals did not score. The only possible explanation would be a turnover. But who turned it over? Could a Hightower fumble cover up be behind the phantom two points? Jordan thinks so.<br/>
<br/>
Hannebaum is refusing to comment on the matter, except to say that he was not behind the point adjustment. However, the league bylaws may tell an intriguing tale. They state that the only people with the authority to adjust official scores are the league commissioner&hellip;<br/>
<br/>
&hellip;and the league owner. Who would be one Jared Allen.<br/>
<br/>
Could this be a conspiracy by Allen, a well-known Republican, to humiliate and oppress a team named after a Democratic president? Allen is also refusing to comment on the matter, laughing it off as &ldquo;gosh damn ridiculous.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
But the circumstances under which this adjustment took place, coupled with the fact that it snatched victory from the jaws of Obama and kept them winless (0-7) on the season, makes the situation anything but ridiculous to some. Asked if he would appeal the score, Jordan scoffed.<br/>
<br/>
&ldquo;Put my reputation on the line to move from 0-7 to 1-6?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Uh, no. But I do know how to hold a grudge.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
So that&rsquo;s that. For now, at least. Obama remains without a victory, and we remain without an answer to this puzzle.
