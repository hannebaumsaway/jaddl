	You knew this was coming when the Millennium Falcons were featured: an article littered with Star Wars quotes.<br><br>	<i>Uh, everything is under control. Situation normal.</i> Despite starting out 1-4, the Falcons have righted the ship (which will make point-five past light speed) and won their last two games by an average of 31 points, scoring in triple figures both times out. Suddenly, they&rsquo;re just one game shy of .500 and within reach of a coveted top six slot.<br><br>	<i>That&rsquo;s great, kid! Don&rsquo;t get cocky.</i> That being said, the Falcons still have an asteroid field to weave through, as four of their final six opponents have winning records. Falcons WR Chad Ochocinco doesn&rsquo;t seem concerned. Since being acquired by owner Ian Wolfe, Ochocinco has fully embraced his inner geek to support the franchise.<br>	<div class='news-quote'>I&rsquo;m not saying &ldquo;kiss the baby&rdquo; anymore. I&rsquo;m saying &ldquo;kiss the Wookiee.&rdquo;<div class='author'>Falcons WR Chad Ochocinco</div></div><br>	&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying &lsquo;kiss the baby&rsquo; anymore,&rdquo; declared Ochocinco. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m saying &lsquo;kiss the Wookiee&rsquo; instead.&rdquo;<br><br>	<i>She&rsquo;s the ship that made the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs. She&rsquo;s fast enough for ya, old man.</i> The road ahead may be daunting, but the Falcons are winning with more than just smoke and mirrors. They&rsquo;ve averaged 117.4 points the past two weeks, even taking home the Briefly Badass award this past weekend for the league&rsquo;s highest score. They&rsquo;re led by a speedy trio of deep-threat receivers: Marques Colston, Donald Driver, and Ochocinco, all of whom average double figures. Wolfe also has two 18-point-average QBs at his disposal in Phillip Rivers and Joe Flacco.<br><br>	<i>Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.</i> The ancient weapon in this case was wielded by the Falcons&rsquo; latest victim, the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks: LaDainian Tomlinson. The &rsquo;Shanks are in full-fledged implosion mode, having dropped their last five games, most in embarrassing fashion; the latest, of course, a 119.6 &mdash; 88.5 drubbing at the hands of the Falcons.<br><br>	<i>She&rsquo;ll hold together. Hear me baby? Hold together.</i> It will be a crucial next few weeks for the boys from a galaxy far, far away. Take down 4-3 Team Hauloll in Week 8, and they may leap them in the standings. Lose and drop to 3-5, and the margin for error becomes zero.<br><br>	<i>You cannot escape your destiny.</i> Or can they? The destiny for first-year franchises in the JADDL has been total and complete suckage. A playoff appearance would certainly buck that trend. But can the Falcons do it? Or will there be <i>always with them that which cannot be done?</i> We&rsquo;ll have to wait for the answer, because&hellip;<br><br>	<i>Difficult to see the future is.</i>
