	Apparently the old saying is true: without drunk people, there wouldn&rsquo;t be any designated drivers. The JADDL seems to be celebrating this adage early in the 2009 season, seeing as how its top two teams have beer-related names.<br><br>	The first of those two teams, the IPA Guzzlers, was the only undefeated team to survive last weekend unblemished, taking down the hapless Flying Pigs 76.6 - 70.2. They did so behind the efforts of kind-of-a-dick-but-kind-of-a-nice-guy QB Peyton Manning. Manning is no stranger to winning; he led the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks to the Golden Limousine a year ago.<br><br>	When asked if he was surprised the Guzzlers were 3-0, Manning replied, &ldquo;Why should I be? I&rsquo;m on the team now.&rdquo; He then hastened to add, &ldquo;Oh, uh, plus, the group of guys around me is great, and the coach is calling all the right plays, and all that,&rdquo; as he checked his e-mail on his Palm Pre.<br><br>	Manning may exude confidence, but he&rsquo;ll just come off looking like a jackass if his teammates don&rsquo;t pick up the slack soon. The only other Guzzlers in double figures were Cedric Benson (14.1) and Steve Smith (12.3). Notice to the Guzzlers: when you score 76.6 points and win, it isn&rsquo;t because you rocked; it&rsquo;s because your opponent blew. Case in point: the Pigs also only had three players in double figures, and one of them was the kicker. Sweet game, guys.<br><br>	But, the Guzzlers are 3-0 and atop the JADDL regardless of who they&rsquo;ve played, and it must feel good for owner Lannie, whose franchise (formerly Mr. Mclovin) went 3-10 in 2008. That&rsquo;s right: they&rsquo;ve already matched their win total from last season.<br>	<div class='news-quote'>Why should I be [surprised]?

That&rsquo;s how I roll.&rdquo;<br><br>	Uh, hate to break it to you Lannie, but your crew also went 4-8-1 in 2007. If three wins for a team that has averaged 3.5 wins in its entire tenure isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;the rule,&rdquo; what is? So, forgive us for raising an eyebrow when we see the Guzzlers in first place. Hilariously, a win next week will tie the franchise&rsquo;s best-ever mark. That win would make believers out of some Guzzler haters out there, though, as the IPA boys are headed to Lawrence to take on model franchise The Mighty Boom. &ldquo;And Boom goes the pretenders&rdquo;? We&rsquo;ll see.
