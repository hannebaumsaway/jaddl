	Holy shit.<br><br>	The Return of Ron Mexico waltzed into L-town in search of its first victory, but crawled out with a bruised forehead instead after being teabagged by Chris Johnson and The Mighty Boom (2-0) to the tune of 132.9 - 92.7.<br><br>	You&rsquo;d think Ron Mexico might like that, being Ron Mexico and all, but no. Now 0-2 despite averaging an okay 88.7 points per game, Mexico owner Alex is getting nervous.<br><br>	&ldquo;I feel like I&rsquo;ve just been raped by a blue whale,&rdquo; Alex moaned after the game.<br><br>	Why would Alex feel that way? Probably because Boom RB Chris Johnson gang-banged the Mexico defense&mdash;by himself&mdash;en route to 52.4 points.<br><br>	52.4 fucking points. I say again: holy shit.<br><br>	Johnson appeared to be extremely pissed at the press conference following the game. When asked what inspired his performance (the best in JADDL history), Johnson whipped out his wallet and showed reporters a picture. What was it a picture of, you ask? A tiny Yorkshire Terrier, perched atop a stool in front of velvet drapery, complete with a silk bow tied around its neck.<br><br>	&ldquo;This is Muffin,&rdquo; Johnson explained. &ldquo;This lil&rsquo; badass is my world, man. When I heard what Michael Dick did to those bow-wows, man, it made me crazy. They put his ass in Leavenworth to protect him from me. So I waited until today to show people what happens to dog-hatin&rsquo; punks.&rdquo;<div class='news-quote'>I feel like I&rsquo;ve just been raped by a blue whale.<div class='author'>Alex, The Return of Ron Mexico owner</div></div><br><br>	The Return of Ron Mexico backup QB Ron Mex&mdash;er, Michael Vick&mdash;was unavailable for comment after the game. However, his husband, Leavenworth Penitentiary inmate #1135178, spoke to reporters on the Tuesday morning league conference call.<br><br>	&ldquo;Mikey is a sweet guy, he really is,&rdquo; said #1135178. &ldquo;He just doesn&rsquo;t know how to say &lsquo;no&rsquo; to his friends. But I worked on that with him these past couple years&mdash;among other things.&rdquo;<br><br>	Well, Mexico needs to learn how to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to opposing running backs, or instead of a playoff run, it could be a season full of ass-poundings. But enough about Michael Vick and inmate #1135178. This game was all about Chris &ldquo;Hang Half a Hundred on&mdash;&rdquo; Johnson.
