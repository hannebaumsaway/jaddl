	Things that were less effective than Team Hauloll&rsquo;s defense this past weekend: the Kansas City Chiefs&rsquo; offense; the polio vaccine; birth control; Sex Panther cologne from <i>Anchorman</i>&hellip;the list goes on.<br><br>	In a sport dominated by offensive stars, Hauloll&rsquo;s defense ruled the day, owning In Pursuit of Perfection to the tune of 32 points en route to a 120.9 - 103.7 victory. 32, in case you aren&rsquo;t fantasy football-savvy (looking at you, Andrew), is a huge freaking number for a D/ST slot. To put that into perspective, the Rams D/ST unit scored 32 points total in 2008.<br><br>	&ldquo;We get no respect, and we wanted to show the world that that&rsquo;s bullshit,&rdquo; said some random Hauloll defender after the game (the JADDL does not recognize individual defensive players). &ldquo;We play just as hard as the offensive guys, and we&rsquo;re just as responsible for the wins that we get.&rdquo;<br>	<div class='news-quote'>They all look the same to me&mdash;like shadows with white question marks for faces.<div class='author'>Jason, Team Hauloll owner</div></div><br>	Well, random defender, no you&rsquo;re not. Not usually, anyway. But hey, today is their day, whoever they are.<br><br>	&ldquo;When I signed those random guys over there, I knew I had something special,&rdquo; commented Hauloll owner Jason, prince of Marysville, KS. &ldquo;I mean, I have no idea who any of them are, and they all look the same to me&mdash;like shadows with white question marks for faces&mdash;but you&rsquo;d be hard-pressed to find a more unique, special group of eleven random guys anywhere.&rdquo;<br><br>	The ramifications of this newfound defensive prowess are coming quickly. One of the random Hauloll defensive players claims to already have brokered an endorsement deal with LifeLock, the identity theft company. Another is supposedly in talks to play Dr. Claw&mdash;whose face is never seen&mdash;in the upcoming Inspector Gadget film.<br><br>	It&rsquo;s nice to see a bunch of random guys getting so much random recognition, but they better not get too comfortable. Chances are, Jason will drop them in a heartbeat if the 11 random guys who are playing against the St. Louis Rams next week are available.
