	Rookies&hellip;psh. In 2007, Andrew&rsquo;s Mr. Intensity squad joined the JADDL, replacing Miller Time. The following year, Mr. Intensity bowed out, making way for John J.&rsquo;s Fifth Reich, while the rest of the league stayed constant. What did Miller Time, Mr. Intensity, and The Fifth Reich all have in common?<br><br>	They were all utter failures.<br><br>	None of the one-and-done franchises reached the playoffs. None of them even finished with winning records. Only one&mdash;Mr. Intensity&mdash;managed to stay out of the league cellar at the conclusion of the regular season, finishing 4-8-1; good for ninth place.<br><br>	That&rsquo;s right: 4-8-1 is the best mark a first-year franchise has mustered to date. Hold your applause and keep the confetti bagged until the end, please.<br><br>	This year&rsquo;s challenger to break the cycle of newbie suckiness is the Millennium Falcons, owned by Ian. The Falcons already have two natural rivals: the Leavenworth Law Dogs (whose location depends on Michael Vick&rsquo;s next destination) and The Mighty Boom. The Law Dogs are owned by Ian&rsquo;s brother-in-law, Alex. If having&hellip;relations&hellip;with one&rsquo;s sister doesn&rsquo;t create a rivalry, what does? As for the potential rivalry with The Mighty Boom, Boom owner Peter is a huge Star Wars nerd, so he might not take kindly to the fact that a challenger to his nerd supremacy has entered the ring. The time for the two of them to whip out their lightsabers and duel it out is near at hand.<br><br>	Ian represents a JADDL first, as well: he&rsquo;s the league&rsquo;s first owner who has football experience beyond high school. But that may be offset by the fact that he&rsquo;s a Denver Broncos fan. Which influence will win out? Time will tell, but a successful first-year franchise is as yet something JADDL fans aren&rsquo;t accustomed to. May the Force be with you, Ian.
