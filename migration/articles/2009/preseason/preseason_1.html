	Last year&rsquo;s JADDL Championship Game was one for the ages. Forget the ho-hum return of Team Odouls to the bittersweet playoff runner-up spot, a role Odouls owner Adam was less than thrilled to reprise. Forget that the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks are no strangers to the top of the mountain (they&rsquo;ve won two of the last four league titles). Look at last year&rsquo;s championship game itself.<br>	<br>	Talk about a classic.<br>	<br>	Odouls rushed out to a 118.5 &mdash; 88.7 lead by the time all its players had turned in their scores. The Longshanks had just RB DeAngelo Williams left; the deficit seemed insurmountable to all but the most optimistic &rsquo;Shanks faithful. However, Williams ran roughshod over the Giants&rsquo; defense en route to three first-half touchdowns, and added another one late, to punch in 34.8 points and give the Longshanks an incredible 123.5 &mdash; 118.5 victory, along with the Golden Limousine.<br>	<br>	History tells us it&rsquo;s a good thing for &rsquo;Shanks owner Ryan that his victory in &rsquo;08 was memorable, because it&rsquo;s unlikely he&rsquo;ll taste the same success this season. Never in the JADDL&rsquo;s tenure has a team repeated as champions. There are teams that have multiple titles to their credit (the Longshanks and Red Hornets both have two), but no one has triumphed in consecutive years. The closest thing to it? Team Odouls, repeating as the &ldquo;hey, we played in the championship game too!&rdquo; sucker. It&rsquo;s doubtful Adam will be jumping for joy at that accomplishment anytime soon, though.<br>	<br>	The odds are stacked against the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks driving the Golden Limo home again this year, but as they say, there&rsquo;s a first time for everything. In the immortal words of Lloyd Christmas:<br>	<br>	&ldquo;&mdash;So you&rsquo;re sayin&rsquo; there&rsquo;s a chance!&rdquo;
