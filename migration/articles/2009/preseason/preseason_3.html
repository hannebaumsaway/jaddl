	No, that headline isn&rsquo;t from some bizarro alternate-universe version of World War II.  John, owner of former JADDL franchise Fifth Reich, has withdrawn his team from the league to pursue a teaching position in Bangladesh.<br><br>	Stop loading Wikipedia in your browser; the research has been done for you&mdash;that&rsquo;s how the Commish rolls.  Apparently, the People&rsquo;s Republic of Bangladesh is a small country in South Asia, bordered on almost all sides by India, a country people can readily locate on a map (unlike Bangladesh).  Its capital, Dhaka, is pronounced like something the terrorists in <i>Team America: World Police</i> would say.<div class='news-quote'>&#x0986&#x09AE &#x09C1&#x0995&#x09CD &#x09A4 &#x0986&#x0986&#x09C1&#x0986&#x0986&#x09BF&#x0986 &#x09BF &#x09C1&#x0995&#x09CD &#x09CD&#x09B7&#x09BE.<div class='author'>John, owner of The Fifth Reich</div></div><br><br>	John will be teaching English in Bangladesh&rsquo;s second largest city, Chittagong (yes, really).  Presumably, as an ambassador of the JADDL, he will be teaching them about the wonders of fantasy football as well.  Regarding the latter, the JADDL Owners&rsquo; Association made an official recommendation last week that the punishment should be thirty lashes for any Bangladeshi who mistakenly thinks the &ldquo;football&rdquo; in &ldquo;fantasy football&rdquo; refers to soccer.  When this article went to press, John had yet to comment on the recommendation.<br><br>	However, he did offer this statement to the media when he announced his withdrawal from the league: &ldquo;&#x0986&#x09AE &#x09C1&#x0995&#x09CD &#x09A4 &#x0986&#x0986&#x09C1&#x0986&#x0986&#x09BF&#x0986 &#x09BF &#x09C1&#x0995&#x09CD &#x09CD&#x09B7&#x09BE.&rdquo;<br><br>	And now, your thirty-second guide to Bangladesh:<br>
	<ul>
		<li>Bangladesh is the seventh most populous country in the world.</li>
		<li>Its official language is Bengali.</li>
		<li>It&rsquo;s one of the &ldquo;Next Eleven&rdquo; major world economies according to Goldman Sachs bank.</li>
		<li>Its national sport is Kabbadi. Fantasy Kabbadi has yet to hit the mainstream public.</li>
		<li>Islam dominates the religious scene with 87.7% of the practicing public. Christianity is a distant fourth with 0.3%, barely edging out Animism.</li>
		<li>Bangladeshis drive on the wrong (left) side of the road.</li>
		<li>Used to be known as East Pakistan, but switched to Bangladesh in 1971 based on the results of a nationwide poll. The other choices were &ldquo;Derka Derka,&rdquo; &ldquo;Cincinnatibengali,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bob.&rdquo;</li>
		<li>Though commonly associated with &ldquo;Siam,&rdquo; Bangladesh is encompassed by the &ldquo;India&rdquo; territory in Risk. Bangladeshis have petitioned Parker Bros. to have their own territory in the game.</li>
