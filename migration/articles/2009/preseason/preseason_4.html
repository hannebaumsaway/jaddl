	Fans adore him.  Women shed clothing at the sight of him.  Drivers avoid him like the plague.  And the JADDL is named after him.<br><br>	Yes, Jared Allen is quite the character.  When he formed the JADDL back in the summer of 2007, he said it was because that was &ldquo;as close as I will ever come to knowing what it felt like in ancient Rome to be the emperor and send gladiators to their death with a wave of my hand.  Bet that was sweet.&rdquo;<br><br>	So what is Allen doing these days?<br><br>	On March 22nd, 2008, Jared opened up a sports bar in Kansas City (that&rsquo;s right: suck it, Minneapolis), cleverly named&hellip;Jared Allen&rsquo;s Sports Arena & Grill.  Even sweeter than the name is the official motto: &ldquo;Wine &rsquo;Em, Dine &rsquo;Em, 69 &rsquo;Em.&rdquo;  The bar serves something called &ldquo;Jared Juice,&rdquo; which isn&rsquo;t what most hot girls in the city wanted it to be; it&rsquo;s fruit punch laced with Everclear, or, more accurately, Everclear laced with fruit punch.  Yummy.<br><br>	When he was traded to the Vikings on April 22nd, 2008, fans worried that he would shut down the league.  But Allen quickly dismissed those fears, saying in a press conference that &ldquo;nothing would change but the heating bill at headquarters, and&mdash;because of the heating bill&mdash;ticket prices at the gates.&rdquo;  <div class='news-quote'>If I wanted to taste piss in my mouth, I&rsquo;d piss in my mouth.<div class='author'>Jared Allen</div></div>Those rising ticket prices didn&rsquo;t deter fans, as attendance across the JADDL rose 9% that year.<br><br>	He recently spoke out against the astronomical signing bonuses rookies are getting, saying &ldquo;they haven&rsquo;t earned jack shit, and I&rsquo;m awesome, so get out of my face with these signing bonuses, GMs.&rdquo;<br><br>	Allen hasn&rsquo;t gotten a DUI since racking up his third in September 2006.  He says he&rsquo;s stopped drinking altogether, thanks to the owners-slash-DDs in the JADDL; friends say he&rsquo;s &ldquo;less cool now,&rdquo; but they &ldquo;get it.&rdquo; Contrary to popular rumors, Allen hates O&rsquo;doul&rsquo;s, stating that &ldquo;If I wanted to taste piss in my mouth, I&rsquo;d piss in my mouth. My dick is big enough.&rdquo;  Team Odouls owner Adam Jones declined to comment on the league owner&rsquo;s potentially damaging remarks.
