	Just when you think there are things in this world you can count on after all, something like this happens.<br>	<br>	DC Football Obama (1-8) was looking every bit like they would make a historic run at 0-13. As John pointed out in his weekly column, they were the complete package, a fully operational losing machine. They could get blown out; they could sneak under a weak opposing score, or score points in bunches in a shootout resulting in a nail-biting loss; they could lose controversially.<br>	<br>	But this past weekend, against a solid team&mdash;Team Hauloll (5-4)&mdash;this Lossem-O 4000 (homage to <i>South Park</i>) collective machine did something no one thought it was capable of doing.<br>	<br>	It won.<br>	<br>	Now, we could spend the rest of this article discussing what this win means for the Football Obama franchise, owner James, the fans in D.C., etc., but c&rsquo;mon. It means nothing. They&rsquo;re going to return to losing, and even if they win a few more, they aren&rsquo;t playoff bound, so it&rsquo;ll be an exercise in futility.<br>	<br>	So instead, we&rsquo;re going to pay tribute to the incredible losing streak that was. Seven games that showed the world what James&rsquo; management is all about:<br>	<br>	<b>Embarrassing Loss Mode &ndash;</b> The Obaminations got this brand of defeat out of the way early, in Week 1. Going up against the defending champs, DC did their part to keep the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks looking like the defending champs, rolling over and taking it up the wahoo 60.3&ndash;126.8.<br>	<br>	<b>Big 10 Style Loss Mode &ndash;</b> You know when you flip over to ESPN and they&rsquo;re showing a Big 10 game, and it&rsquo;s 7&ndash;6 in the 4th? Booooooring. But the Obamas said, <i>Yeah, I can do that!</i>&hellip;and they were talking about being the team that gives up 7 and loses. Case in point: a 79.0&ndash;84.5 loss in Week 8 to The IPA Guzzlers.<br>	<br>	<b>Arena League Loss Mode &ndash;</b> James didn&rsquo;t want his squad to be pigeonholed into a low scoring loser. After all, diversity is the name of the Obama administration. So, the Fighting Presidents went out and bit the dust in shootout fashion to Team odouls, 104.5&ndash;104.6. This game also serves as the example for&hellip;<br>	<br>	<b>Conspiracy Theorists Unite Loss Mode &ndash;</b> That tenth-of-a-point loss to Odouls would have been dramatic enough on its own, but it came with an asterisk to boot. Obama closed Sunday night out with a narrow 1.9-point lead, and all players for both teams were in the books. Game over, right? Wrong. On Monday morning, the Big O was awarded two extra points in a scoring &ldquo;correction,&rdquo; giving them the slimmest victory possible. Rumors immediately flooded the blogosphere about league owner Jared Allen&mdash;a known Republican&mdash;making the scoring adjustment to stick it to the left-wing gridiron gang, but nothing ever came of the allegation.
