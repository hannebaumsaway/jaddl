    The defending West Division champions got 2016 off to a rough start last week. In a loss to the Red Hornets, the Angry Monkeys scored the second fewest points in the league. Kicker Justin Tucker scored more than four of the five RB/WRs in Tulsa&rsquo;s starting lineup that day. Not great.<br/>
    <br/>
    But the current owners of Jared&rsquo;s Goblet rebounded in Week 2 in a big way. In a near total reversal of fortune, not only did the Monkeys win, defeating In Pursuit of Perfection 105.6&ndash;88.3, but they also took home a Briefly Badass in the process.<br/>
    <br/>
    Now, let&rsquo;s be honest here. Only twice in the past two-plus seasons has a team won the Briefly Badass with a score lower than 105.6. So it&rsquo;s not like the Monkeys set the JADDL world on fire in this game. But clearly, neither did anyone else, so you take the hardware where and when you can get it.<br/>
    <br/>
    When you look at this game in particular, two things jump out at you. First, you wonder how in the hell the Monkeys put up a good number when their running backs scored a combined 6.2 points. This is down even from their poor output of 12.0 in Week 1. Put another way: the Monkeys&rsquo; running back tandem of Justin Forsett and Jonathan Stewart sucks. They were both outscored in Week 1 by flex RB play and AARP spokesman Frank Gore.<br/>
    <br/>
    The second thing that you notice about the Week 2 Monkeys victory, on the flip side, is where the points actually <i>did</i> come from. That would be the volatile duo of their D/ST and kicker slots. Yes, the Monkeys got 36 points from Justin Tucker and the Cardinals defense. Maybe the Bad News Bensons should have made a draft day trade for Tucker again this season. He&rsquo;s currently the number two kicker in the league, just out there kicking footballs and slaying skirts in Tulsa like a boss.<br/>
    <br/>
    The Monkeys also got 22.8 from wide receiver Kelvin Benjamin, after he put up 15 in the first week. Those marks are good enough to make him the top receiver in the entire league through these first two weeks.<br/>
    <br/>
    &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just trying to get all the production we can out of Kelvin before he inevitably goes back on the IR for the remainder of the season, which should happen any day now,&rdquo; said Jacob.<br/>

    <br/>
    Speaking of Jacob, he made the news himself this weekend as reports out of Tulsa claimed he was viciously attacked by a wild creature while on a walk near his Tulsa residence. Those reports were later confirmed by Monkeys players in the locker room following the game. &ldquo;We wanted to give Jacob a win this week after all he&rsquo;s gone through,&rdquo; quarterback Ben Roethlisberger told the media. &ldquo;It has to be so embarrassing to get taken down by a squirrel, so we felt Jacob just needed this one today.&rdquo;<br/>
    <br/>
    Yes, folks, the exuberant Monkeys owner was bitten and bedridden by a squirrel. There is some speculation that the raging squirrel was planted at the scene by the owner of the Monkeys&rsquo; Week 2 opponent and former Ragin&rsquo; Black Squirrels Association commissioner Nolan McDonald, but sources have been so far unable to confirm. We&rsquo;ll keep you abreast of the situation as it continues to unfold.<br/>
    <br/>
    In the meantime, this victory has to be a pretty effective remedy for Jacob&rsquo;s ailing pride, as his Monkeys were swept by IPP a year ago in the regular season.
