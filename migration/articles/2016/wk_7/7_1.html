    In Pursuit of Perfection might be the hottest team in the JADDL no one&rsquo;s really talking about. A 4-3 record by itself doesn&rsquo;t exactly turn heads, but IPP has won three of it&rsquo;s last four after starting 1-2, and they&rsquo;ve scored in triple figures in all three of those wins. All that has propelled them to second place in the West behind The Lanniesters, in both wins and points.<br/>
    <br/>
    Maybe they aren&rsquo;t being talked about because they&rsquo;re kind of winning without any real star power on their team. Antonio Brown had a monster first week, but has been fairly pedestrian&mdash;albeit very solid&mdash;since. LeSean McCoy was a large reason Pursuit has won three of the last four; he averaged 16.5 points per game over that stretch. But now an injury appears to have slowed him some. Once the league caught up to rookie Carson Wentz, sending him to the bench, Kirk Cousins stepped in.<br/>
    <br/>
    Wentz. Cousins. You aren&rsquo;t going to see a lot of people wearing those jerseys around the streets of Wichita, let alone anywhere else in the country.<br/>
    <br/>
    But Cousins has been a sneakily steady producer for Nolan&rsquo;s squad. I mean, remarkably steady, considering we&rsquo;re talking about Kirk Cousins here. Check out these point totals: 18, 23, 17, 12 (oops), 17, 22. He may not go grab a game by the balls and win it for you, but he&rsquo;s not going to lose it for you either right now.<br/>

    The real hero unit for IPP, though, might just be its DST. Those faceless men running around out there murking fools anonymously for the good of the team. Nolan&rsquo;s defenses have scored 10+ in three of the last four games, which, as you know, is an excellent rate of return in the game of craps that is picking a DST. That includes the pile of points the Eagles DST gave IPP this past weekend in a 117.7&ndash;100.6 win over East foe the Millennium Falcons. IPP&rsquo;s DST went out and poured on 24 points. An average game from them&mdash;say, six points&mdash;and they lose. Who would have thought, just a few years ago, that we&rsquo;d be talking about the fucking <i>Eagles</i> as the second best defense in the JADDL? Weird times, man. Weird times.<br/>
    <br/>
    And those Eagles were dumped by Lawrence Football Jesus&mdash;twice.<br/>
    <br/>
    &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had my eye on the Eagles for some time now, and I was cursing myself for not snatching them the first time they became available,&rdquo; Nolan said. &ldquo;So when James idiotically dropped them again, I grabbed them like they were a pussy and I was Donald Trump.&rdquo;<br/>
    <br/>
    That joke is OK, right guys?<br/>
    <br/>
    Anyway, IPP is proving the old mantra that the best offense is a good defense. Wait, that&rsquo;s not how it goes, but we&rsquo;ll roll with it.<br/>
    <br/>
    It would be irresponsible not to acknowledge the game Jeremy Hill had in Week 7 as well. Pursuit&rsquo;s fourth round pick has been a massive disappointment overall. He scored in double digits just once before this past weekend, but he finally broke out in a big way, to the tune of 27 points. Maybe this will be the catalyst to get him going. Of course, he scored 22 in Week 3 as well, and then followed that up by scoring seven, one, and four points in his next three games, so let&rsquo;s not count our pumpkins before they&rsquo;re carved here.<br/>
    <br/>
    IPP rounds out interdivisional play with a date with East powerhouse The Mighty Boom, which of course will be no easy chore. They have a massive game against the West leading Lanniesters in Week 10 looming too, but luckily they get to play the 1-6 Angry Monkeys between those two juggernauts to rest up and recuperate.
