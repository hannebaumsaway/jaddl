    Alright, so I told you guys last week&mdash;or was it two weeks ago?&mdash;that we need to mix up the newsletter a bit. Jason had a great idea about making it more of a notes rundown, possibly with standard segments. For now, let&rsquo;s just freestyle it a bit, stream-of-conscience style. That&rsquo;s my preferred writing method anyway. Just call me Eminem.<br/>
    <br/>
    As I sit here checking out the league of late, I have a few thoughts. The first, because a) it&rsquo;s so shocking to me personally, and b) it&rsquo;s naturally the first team I look at each day, is the sudden life for the Longshanks. It wasn&rsquo;t so long ago that I really thought they had a legit shot to be our first 0-13 team. They went the first eight weeks of the season without breaking 80, a &ldquo;feat&rdquo; not accomplished since the infamously terrible 2007 Football Jesus and Upset Underdogs (ha!) did so. Week 8 was the Longshanks&rsquo; worst outing yet. And then they go out and hang 113 on the Millennium Falcons? No one saw that coming, least of all me. Then they back it up with 104 against archrival Boom in a second consecutive victory. Speaking of which, the Shanks really should be worse against Boom than they are, considering the quality of the two franchises. The Shanks are now 7-11 all time, and they&rsquo;ve won three of the last five against The Mighty. That&rsquo;s&hellip;weird. Probably doesn&rsquo;t sit too well with Pete, I&rsquo;m guessing.<br/>
    <br/>
    The Shanks&rsquo; surge can be attributed quite a bit to Marcus Mariota, who quietly has crept up to be the #4 quarterback in the league. Not bad for an 11th round pick who was dropped six weeks ago and reacquired a week later.<br/>
    <br/>
    So the Shanks, once the star of and #0and13Watch, are now 3-7, but more suprisingly, are out of the East cellar, now occupied by the Falcons. The reprieve may only last a week. But that&rsquo;s a week longer than any of us anticipated.<br/>
    <br/><hr><br>
    Lawrence Football Jesus has recovered nicely for a little hiccup midseason to prove unequivically that they&rsquo;re for real. They&rsquo;ve won four straight and have actually joined the Bad News Bensons in clinching a playoff spot already. James&rsquo; selection of Mike Evans in the 2nd round raised a few eyebrows, but that dude is the second best receiver in the league to date. He also made headlines by using the national anthem as a platform to protest the election, something I&rsquo;m sure Jimbo encouraged him to do.<br/>
    <br/><hr><br>
    But the class of the East is still BNB. Alex has his squad rollin&rsquo;. The Bensons have scored triple digits seven times this season; no one else has more than four such scores. They already have a win in hand (and 29 points) over Jesus, too, should that be necessary when seeding time comes around. The Cigarette, man. The Cigarette.<br/>
    <br/><hr><br>
	Speaking of teams that are for real, how about those Red Hornets? They haven&rsquo;t won seven games in a <i>season</i> in six years, and here they sit at 7-3 with three games left. Nicely done, Dan-o. The Hornets are also currently on top of the West, so some hardware is obviously in play. They&rsquo;ve been remarkably adept at picking their spots this season: when they played the Shanks back in Week 8, they knew they could take it easy, rest some guys, and escape with a W after scoring in the 60s; the next two weeks their opponents scored in the hundreds, so the Hornets did too, winning twice more. It sure looks like we&rsquo;re getting our first Red Hornets playoff appearance since 2009. That should be fun.<br/>
	<br/><hr><br>
	Finally, on the Debbie Downer side of the West, you gotta feel for the Monkeys. They&rsquo;re the 2016, West Division version of the 2011 Shanks. #TheCurse is back and living large in Tulsatown. On the surface: they suck. They&rsquo;re 1-9, futility not seen with them since their Flying Pigs days (since their rebrand, they haven&rsquo;t finished with a losing record). And look, they&rsquo;re not exactly helping themselves. They&rsquo;ve only scored 100+ once, way back in Week 2. That&rsquo;s one time less than the Shanks have, for those keeping track. But man, teams usually catch some breaks here and there, and the Monkeys just haven&rsquo;t. They&rsquo;ve scored 97.7, 99.1, 94.2&hellip;and lost each time. They&rsquo;re on pace to break the record pace for points against set emphatically by the 2012 Shanks; opponents score, on average, 111.5 points per game against the Monkeys, which is just absurd.<br/>
	<br/>
	So, Jacob: I&rsquo;m sorry man.
