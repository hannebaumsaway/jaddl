    Okay guys, these articles are getting harder and harder to write. Time just isn&rsquo;t nearly as ample as it once was, as I&rsquo;m sure is the case for all of you. I owed Jones a uni and article from a week ago and just now got his Photoshop done.<br/>
    <br/>
    So what say you? What if I just move my communication solely to Twitter for little observations and one-liners throughout each week, and use this more like an image gallery for the uniforms? Would that upset you all? I feel like the articles are getting repetititve anyway. I can only cover fake football games in so many unique ways before common threads start to course through them all.<br/>
    <br/>
    So Jones: I&rsquo;m sorry buddy. I wanted to get you your jersey at least, but you aren&rsquo;t going to get any robust article this year. At least not for last week&rsquo;s game, anyway.
