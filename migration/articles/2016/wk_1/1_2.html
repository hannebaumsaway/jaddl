    First off, in order for this article to make sense, you have to head over to The DDL and read James&rsquo;s <a href="http://jaddl.tumblr.com/post/150662069112/no-i-dont-really-like-the-unis" target="_blank">excellent post about uniforms in the JADDL</a>. So, go do that, right now. I&rsquo;ll wait.<br/>
    <br/>
    &hellip;<br/>
    <br/>
    Back? Good. Now that you&rsquo;ve read James&rsquo;s criticism of my uniform tinkering, you may be expecting a rebuttal here. You&rsquo;ll get nothing of the sort. Instead, you&rsquo;ll get a <i>mea culpa,</i> and a plea for the rest of you bums to follow James&rsquo;s lead.<br/>
    <br/>
    James says there is some &ldquo;creeping Ryan Hannebaum&rdquo; going on in his uniform design, and hopefully he meant scope creep, and not that I&rsquo;m a creepy guy. Let&rsquo;s go with the scope creep angle. He&rsquo;s absolutely right. It&rsquo;s overwhelmingly tempting for me each year to tweak your uniforms in pursuit of aesthetic perfection, and to keep things fresh from a design perspective. It&rsquo;s called the Designer&rsquo;s Curse; we constantly tweak and tamper with and erase and redo what we&rsquo;ve created, never satisfied that the thing we&rsquo;re messing with is <i>quite</i> right.<br/>
    <br/>
    That&rsquo;s good, you may think, to never be content with &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; or to &ldquo;settle.&rdquo; But here&rsquo;s the problem, and why it&rsquo;s called a curse and not a blessing:<br/>
    <br/>
    It&rsquo;s not my uniform. It&rsquo;s for James. It&rsquo;s for you. You&rsquo;re the client.<br/>
    <br/>
    If you haven&rsquo;t ever given me specifications on how you want your franchise to look&mdash;first of all, shame on you&mdash;you&rsquo;re subject to my whims and perfectionist tinkering. That&rsquo;s on you. You&rsquo;ll get what you get. It&rsquo;ll still look great (in my humble opinion). But you get out what you put in. So if you have desires, like James did, for your uniforms, fucking tell me! I may be one hell of a fantasy football commissioner, but that sadly does not make me omniscient.<br/>
    <br/>
    I want more feedback from you guys. I want dozens of comments on articles, I want stringent requirements for your uniforms&hellip;I want interaction! I&rsquo;m a fucking interaction designer for God&rsquo;s sake. It&rsquo;s what I do. And it&rsquo;s fun&mdash;or should be&mdash;for all of us when we&rsquo;re all involved.<br/>
    <br/>
    And now for the <i>mea culpa</i> portion of today&rsquo;s program. James <i>did</i> get involved. He&rsquo;s the poster child for involved. He has The DDL (which he should post to more, even if the posts are a paragraph long). He tweets. He trades. He loves the JADDL. And he provided me with uniform specifications that I adhered to&hellip;and then promptly ignored in the years following.<br/>
    <br/>
    He wants the all-yellows with black lettering. No crusade-era cross. Powder blue helmets (please never ditch those, Jimbo). And dammit, he&rsquo;s going to get them. In the coming weeks, I&rsquo;m giving him a bonus Photoshop in which LFJ will don &ldquo;throwback&rdquo; 2012 jerseys. The fans will love them of course, so&mdash;spoiler alert!&mdash;the franchise front office will decide to go back to them indefinitely, until they instruct otherwise.<br/>
    <br/>
    For the rest of you: try your hand at dictating the design of your unis. If you see some college kits on Saturday or NFL ones Sunday or Monday (or Thursday, God forbid, with those mostly hideous Color Rush monstrosities), take note! Then tell me about them. It&rsquo;s fun; you&rsquo;ll like being the master of your own visual destiny.<br/>
    <br/>
    And I promise to resist the tug of the Designer&rsquo;s Curse and give you what you want, to the best of my ability.
