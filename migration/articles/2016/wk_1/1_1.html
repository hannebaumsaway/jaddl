    We&rsquo;re all well acquainted with the struggles of the Lawrence Football Jesus franchise by now. No trophies in the case other than Briefly Badasses. Two seasons under 1,000 points (a feat matched only by the Angry Monkeys). No playoff wins (a feat matched by no one). An unsuccessful temporary re-brand (remember D.C. Football Obama?). And on and on.<br/>
    <br/>
    Yet there is clearly something going on in Lawrence these days. 2012 saw a breakthrough for Jesus. Behind the poise and leadership of Robert Griffin III&mdash;seriously&mdash;Jesus stormed to its first winning season since the Bush administration. Hope abounded. This was it! The turnaround fans had been waiting for!<br/>
    <br/>
    Then it all went sideways. Jesus started the 2013 &ldquo;prove it&rdquo; campaign with just one win in its first five games, scoring under 75 in three of those games. They&rsquo;d rally to win three of their last four to salvage something from the season, but then 2014 brought only more disappointment in the form of a 3-10 record.<br/>
    <br/>
    However, that 2014 team was an improved one, easy to see for anyone paying attention. They scored nearly 100 more points than the 2013 squad. Their uninspiring record was mostly a facet of having the most points scored against them in the league that year. Sometimes you eat the schedule, and sometimes the schedule fucks you in the ass.<br/>
    <br/>
    Last season built upon the positive momentum instilled in 2014. Again, the record (4-9) was nothing to commemorate, but for the second straight season, LFJ improved its point total&mdash;first time Jesus had improved in consecutive seasons since 2008-09. Hope began to swell in Lawrence, and not among Boom fans (who long ago moved past <i>hope</i> to <i>expect</i>).<br/>

    <br/>
    So here we are in 2016, in a world where Jesus fans are actually looking forward to weekends, to see the Powder Blues out on that virtual field. In the opening week, Jesus did anything but disappoint. They not only won what was undeniably the game of the week, a 141.6&ndash;120.9 barn-burner against the Millennium Falcons, but they scored a Briefly Badass in the process, the first time they&rsquo;ve done so in Week 1. The 141.6 points they put up were the third most in franchise history. Beyond that, they were the second most points by <i>any</i> team in the opening weekend.<br/>
    <br/>
    If you&rsquo;re a Jesus fan and you haven&rsquo;t let your hopes get up and your imagination run wild after that stellar showing, you&rsquo;re an asshole.<br/>
    <br/>
    &ldquo;The Eastern points leader is back, bitches!&rdquo; James tweeted following the game.<br/>
    <br/>
    Oh yes, you didn&rsquo;t remember that? LFJ finished atop the East in points a year ago. Let me repeat that: Lawrence Football Jesus had more points than any other team in the East in 2015. More than The Mighty Boom. More than the Bad News Bensons. More than all of them. The 4-9 record makes that an easily forgettable accomplishment, but don&rsquo;t fall into that trap. Fantasy football is a fickle bitch, and success should not be taken for granted, even when it falls short of ticks in the win column sometimes.<br/>
    <br/>
    James came to Vegas on a mission, full of purpose and resolve piss and vinegar and all of it. He did his homework&mdash;mostly while the draft was going on&mdash;and crafted what he&rsquo;s sure will be the team to shatter all the preconceptions and shake off all the stink that had accumulated on his franchise over so many years.<br/>
    <br/>
    The Royals didn&rsquo;t suck forever. The Cavaliers didn&rsquo;t suck forever. And Lawrence is big enough to hold two championship caliber franchises.
