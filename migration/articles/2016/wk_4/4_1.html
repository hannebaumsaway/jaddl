    It feels like fans and pundits in and around the JADDL don&rsquo;t talk about Lannie&rsquo;s teams much year over year. There&rsquo;s a reason for that, which we&rsquo;ll get to in a bit. But first, let&rsquo;s take a moment to appreciate the good things Lannie&rsquo;s got going.<br/>
    <br/>
    Actually, before we do that, let&rsquo;s acknowledge yet another re-brand for a JADDL franchise! Gone are the days of IPA Connoisseur, and thank God, because that shit was really hard to type. Long gone are the days of IPA Guzzlers, and thank God, because that name was disgusting. Welcome to the Lanniesters Era! A better name, better uniforms (see above), and just better merchandising possibilities all around. The other owners in the league saved Lannie from a horrible, horrible mistake, by convincing him to include the &ldquo;e&rdquo; in Lanniesters.<br/>
    <br/>
    And look at all the good vibes it has brought them! Four weeks into the season and the Lanniesters are without a loss.<br/>
    <br/>
    That&rsquo;s actually not all that rare, however, which is what I alluded to at the outset. This is, in fact, the third time in the last five years the team-formerly-known-as-IPA-Connoisseur started out 4-0. That&rsquo;s a rate even Peter can admire. No, starting out has never been Lannie&rsquo;s problem. It&rsquo;s been finishing. When his teams come out of interdivisional play and play repeat games against West foes, they&rsquo;re just 14-16 since 2010. If you stretch that record all the way back to the beginning of the JADDL in 2007, they&rsquo;re a cringe-worthy 17-28 in the final five weeks of the regular season.<br/>

    <br/>
    Limping to the finish line would be acceptable if Lannie&rsquo;s teams did something noteworthy in the playoffs, but alas, that doesn&rsquo;t happen either.<br/>
    <br/>
    The Lanniesters&mdash;well, Lanniester franchise, anyway&mdash;have won one playoff game. Ever. That&rsquo;s it. A quarterfinal victory over the Angry Monkeys in 2013 is all they&rsquo;ve done in the playoffs. Like, in history. Lannie&rsquo;s team averages 87.7 points per game in the postseason, which is the lowest mark in the entire league. So it&rsquo;s not hard to figure out why the wins haven&rsquo;t come.<br/>
    <br/>
    They choke.<br/>
    <br/>
    Harsh? Perhaps, but I&rsquo;m here to deliver the truth, y&rsquo;all. Maybe Lannie can change the narrative. Certainly, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with starting out 4-0; that&rsquo;s not going to hurt his championship aspirations any.<br/>
    <br/>
    The Lanniesters&rsquo; latest triumph was 136.2&ndash;97.7 win over the aforementioned Monkeys, who fell to 1-3. The big story? Julio Jones. He had 300 fucking yards&mdash;on the dot&mdash;and a touchdown thrown in for good measure. &ldquo;Julio, or &lsquo;Hoo&rsquo; as I call him, told me he&rsquo;s going for 300 every week,&rdquo; Lannie said. But that&rsquo;s not all the Lanniesters had going for them. Blake Bortles, DeMarco Murray, and Isaiah Crowell all went over 20 points on the weekend in the dominating win.<br/>
    <br/>
    The Lanniesters are sitting pretty, 56 up in the points race and atop the division with their unblemished record. Check back with me in about ten weeks, though, and we&rsquo;ll see how the story ends.
