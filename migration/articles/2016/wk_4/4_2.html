	It occurs every week on Sunday and Mondays&mdash;but mostly Tuesdays&mdash;owners look at the scoreboard and click the depressing button of &ldquo;show bench.&rdquo; There, they see the &ldquo;what could have been&rdquo; of their line ups.  It is not often that someone sitting on the bench out performs a starting player.  I would go so far to say that it happens in almost every game for every team.  I myself have been in this situation more times than I would like to in the past years faced with gut decisions that had went wrong.  Whether you were a slave to rankings, sudden injury or lack of performance every owner has seen the middle finger from a bench player saying &ldquo;You should have put me in coach.&rdquo;<br/>
    <br/>
    So let&rsquo;s review some of the bench players that have been stuffed and the outcomes it played with close match ups in the first four weeks of the JADDL.  <br/>
<br/>
<div class="section-header">Week 1</div>
Hauloll lost by 9 points.  That is respectable, not a blowout but close enough to have put up a fight.  His two starting wide receivers combined for a total score of 11.1 while his three WR on the bench scored an average of 11.5.  Switch them out and you gave a win.<br/>
<br/>
Also in week 1 O&rsquo;Doul&rsquo;s top scorer was Theo Riddick with 22.8 on the bench.  The Lannisters left their number 1 guy Andy Dalton sitting with his 19.3 points.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="section-header">Week 2</div>
O&rsquo;Doul&rsquo;s goes down by only 4.5 points.  You have to know that anytime you lose by less than 5 there are going to be multiple options where bench players would have made a difference.  O&rsquo;Doul&rsquo;s loss comes on the back (or lower leg) of Rawls who went down with an injury after only getting 0.8 points.  His three RBs on the bench scored an avg. 6.6 points so any of them would have helped secure a small margin of victory.<br/>
<br/>
Also in week 2 Lannisters threw away another top score in Crowell with 22.8 points.  This is scary since the Lannisters continue to win without their number one score.  Their bench is fucking ridiculous. The Millennium Falcons left T Benjamin on the bench with 25.4.  We also saw a battle between Hauloll and Riley County where both left off their top point getter, their back up QBs who both scored 27.8.  That stat right there will fuck with your mind if you think about it too long.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="section-header">Week 3</div>
No sad story would be complete without mentioning the Shanks.  They lost by 1.7, ouch.  Not only that but they scored a total of 74.6 and their bench was battling them with a total of 70.1.  That is a little too close for comfort. Ryan&rsquo;s back QB and 2 RBs scored better than the players ahead of them in the depth chart.  His defense also scored a big fat 0.<br/>
<br/>
I make a dig at Shanks only to make myself look even worse.  So while Ryan at least got his starting squad to score more than the bench, in week 3 the Monkeys bench outscored the starting line up 81.5 to 81.  That is just sad.  What makes it worse is when you compare the flex position.  I got zero out of K Benjamin and he wasn&rsquo;t hurt and played the whole game. (Throw the ball to him Cam!)  When you average out the other 5 players including the number one scorer Emanuel Sanders at 25.7 they scored on avg. 13.7 points.  Not that any of that would have mattered since I lost by 60 points to another Briefly Badass which you would know if you look at the hidden message board on the ESPN site.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="section-header">Week 4</div>
There were no close games that could have been swung by bench players so maybe coaches are getting it together.  But that didn&rsquo;t stop a few of us from leaving points on the bench.  Bensons top score was 23.6 by D. Carr sitting on his bench.  We all know from twitter that I left Big Ben sitting with a massive 33.9.  But again when I lose by more than 39 points to the Briefly Badass Big Ben doesn&rsquo;t really matter.  You would think that was the biggest line up mistake but Riley County out did me by letting Matt Ryan sit with 39.4 points in his lap keeping that bench warm enough to outscore his starting line up 52.1-51.3.  His bottom 4 players in his line up scored an average of -1.15 points.  Yeah that&rsquo;s a negative average for FOUR players.<br/>
<br/>
Since we are still in the beginning of the season you have plenty of time to tinker with those line ups prior to Sunday morning kickoffs but be warned, not every gut decision ends with a winner.  Often times you watch in torment as the TD vultures and pissed off benched players beat you more often than your opponent&rsquo;s players.<br/>
