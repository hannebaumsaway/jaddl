    When Jason selected Ezekiel Elliot&mdash;a guy who had never played a single snap in the NFL&mdash;with the number seven overall pick in the JADDL Draft, eyebrows were raised. A rookie? A rookie <i>running back?</i> Running backs were losing value in fantasy football! Rookies are unproven! This was going to be 2015 Melvin Gordon all over again!<br/>
    <br/>
    Jason was calmly unfazed, as Jason is wont to be. Then Team Hauloll started out the season a shitty 1-3.<br/>
    <br/>
    This just a year removed from starting a shittier 0-4, fans in the Phoenix metroplex were getting real restless real quick. The JADDL media machine pointed out that Hauloll was just 13-17 since 2013. Fans grumbled. The media drew comparisons to teams like the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks, Red Hornets, and Football Jesus. Fans began to call local radio shows and post on Hauloll message boards in disgust. Jason denied rumors that a change would be made at head coach. &ldquo;Thanks for all the mean tweets. It was just the motivational locker room material my guys needed,&rdquo; Jason would later say.<br/>
    <br/>
    All the while, Ezekiel Elliot kept running, determined to justify his draft position. As he began to get comfortable with the speed of the JADDL, his numbers steadily improved. 11 points. 13. 16.<br/>
    <br/>
    But Hauloll was having trouble putting together a complete game. While Elliot exhibited consistency&mdash;a trait not often associated with rookies&mdash;Hauloll&rsquo;s receivers and quarterback were taking turns shitting the bed. In Week 1, Brandon Marshall and T.Y. Hilton combined for just 11 points. In Week 3, Hilton busted out for 25, but Carson Palmer torpedoed the effort by getting his bitch-ass hurt&hellip;again&hellip;and scoring three points.<br/>

    <br/>
    So Hauloll&rsquo;s prize stallion, their first round choice, decided to take matters into his own hands and become the leader the team seemed to be waiting for.<br/>
    <br/>
    After leading the team in points for the first time in a Week 4 loss, Elliot elevated to another level this past weekend, running with abandon over, around, and through a snake-bitten Angry Monkeys squad. Elliot scored 31.1, Hauloll secured a desperately needed victory, and a franchise record for points in a single game was broken with 149.8 points. Fans were assuaged&mdash;at least for now.<br/>
    <br/>
    Times have been tough lately, but Hauloll Nation is still used to winning. Their boys in the Ivory &amp; Green still rank second in the league in all-time victories, second in playoff appearances, second in all-time points&hellip;you get the idea; they&rsquo;re top two in the league in most statistical categories (damn that Mighty Boom, hogging all the top spots). Hauloll hasn&rsquo;t scored in the 140s since 2007, a year in which they finished 8-5 and made a (brief) postseason showing. Will this impressive performance ignite this year&rsquo;s group, now 2-3, to a return to elimination play for the first time since 2013?<br/>
    <br/>
    Seasons are often made or broken in interdivisional play, which is looming around the corner. A nearly certain win against the laughable Longshanks should get Team Hauloll back to .500. After that the road gets much rockier: a date with overall points leader Lawrence Football Jesus, followed by Team Odouls, which has won two straight.<br/>
    <br/>
    It looks as though the Monkeys are the Cursed Team du Jour, so perhaps this was just a one week jetstream for their opponent, but we&rsquo;ll find out what Hauloll is made of soon enough. Win two of three across the Chasm and there will be plenty of nervous foes back in the West for the home stretch.<br>
    <br>
    <i>EDITOR&rsquo;S NOTE: The story originally said Hauloll had the second overall pick, which was corrected to seventh.</i>
