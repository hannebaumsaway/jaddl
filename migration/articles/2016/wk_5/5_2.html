    It&rsquo;s hard to believe the JADDL once didn&rsquo;t have divisions, isn&rsquo;t it? As we all prepare to engage in yet another iteration of the Chasm War, let&rsquo;s take a look back at all the Wars that have been.<br/>
    <br/>
    But before we do that, let me just say that &ldquo;Chasm War&rdquo; is a terrible fucking moniker. Who uses the word <i>chasm</i> in everyday conversations? Yes, I know I&rsquo;m the one who came up with it&mdash;but why didn&rsquo;t you guys stop me? Let&rsquo;s come up with something new. Maybe we should go all abstract and just call it <i>The War.</i> Or not name it at all and just refer to it as interdivisional play. I need your help. #Owners4Owners, after all. I expect a flood of names in the comments section.<br/>
    <br/>
    Now, with that out of the way, let&rsquo;s dive into our retrospective.<br/>
    <br/>
    <div class="section-header">2010</div>
    On July 13, 2010, James&mdash;with the assistance of Alex&mdash;composed a treatise proposing divisions. Pulling out the Big Book of Quotes he undoubtedly keeps in his desk drawer, James evoked Henry Ford, Jesse Jackson, and Ralph Waldo Emerson to make his case. He warned that consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds&mdash;though the actual essay states that <i>foolish</i> consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, and one could still argue today whether keeping the league undivided would have been foolish or not.<br/>
    <br/>
    The ensuing discussion brought forth questions such as how to divide the teams; think how different the past half-decade would have been had we split north/south (North: Bensons, Falcons, Monkeys, Jesus, Comfort, Boom; South: Odouls, Hornets, Hauloll, Lanniesters, Shanks, IPP). A three-division setup was intriguing to several owners as well. As resident schedule-maker, I&rsquo;m really, really glad we didn&rsquo;t go down that path. Thank you for that.<br/>
    <br/>
    The vote for divisions passed by a 9-3 count, and the east/west split was selected by all but Alex, who wanted north/south.<br/>
    <br/>
    Following the vote, Adam immediately &ldquo;guaranteed&rdquo; the next league champion would come out of the East. JADDL pundits agreed that the East looked like the stronger division on paper, citing The Mighty Boom and (hilariously, in retrospect) the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks as standard bearers for that observation. But, as we know, the 2010 champion <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> come out of the East. Jared Bowl IV saw In Pursuit of Perfection defeat The Bad News Bensons to take home the first divisional era Limousine on behalf of the West. The West also won the Chasm War (ugh) 11-7 that season.<br/>
    <br/>
    <div class="section-header">2011</div>
    The West doubled down on their Chasm War success a year later, going 11-6-1 against the East. They also retained the Limo thanks to West champion One Pump Chumps&rsquo; victory over unlikely East representative Boom&mdash;which went 6-7 in the regular season&mdash;in Jared Bowl V. Not a single team from the West had a losing record individually against the East; an impressive humiliation of an East Division that was rapidly looking like the defunct Big 12 North.<br/>
    <br/>
    Beyond the game results, 2011 still represents the largest point differential in Chasm War history: the West outscored the East by a whopping 227 points.<br/>
    <br/>
    <div class="section-header">2012</div>
    The third Chasm War was a chance for the East to even the score a bit&mdash;literally&mdash;with a 9-9 outcome. Boom and the Chumps didn&rsquo;t lose an interdivisional game; the Shanks and IPA Connoisseur didn&rsquo;t win one. The West did outscore the East, but only by a measly three points. Even Stephen. The East did get the final laugh, finally, as the Millennium Falcons snagged a Jared Bowl victory to close out the 2012 season.<br/>
    <br/>
    <div class="section-header">2013</div>
    The East finally got the upper hand&mdash;it only took them four years after divisions were formed!&mdash;when they won 11 of the 18 games in 2013. The charge was led by an unlikely source: the Longshanks, who went 3-0 against the West despite finishing just 2-8 inside their own division. What&rsquo;s more, the Shanks scored more points that season than any team in the West&hellip;and finished dead last in the East. There was no doubt, in other words, which division was strongest in &rsquo;13. The Mighty Boom confirmed as much with a win over Hauloll in Jared Bowl VII.<br/>
    <br/>
    <div class="section-header">2014</div>
    It looked like the East was about to assert a dominant stretch of its own in earnest when interdivisional play wrapped in the 2014 season. The Easterners took home a landslide result, winning thirteen of the eighteen contests. The 1,816 points scored collectively by the East that year were the most tallied by a division in a Chasm War in league history to that point, by a wide, wide margin. It was, in short, an ass-whooping.<br/>
    <br/>
    Odouls, the Bensons, and the Longshanks all went through the West like a lightsaber through butter, going 9-0 and outscoring their opponents by an average of 34 points per game. Damn. The 389 points scored by the Shanks over the three-week stretch is still a Chasm War single team record. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t call it a Chasm War if they don&rsquo;t fight back,&rdquo; Alex declared. Well&hellip;<br/>
    <br/>
    <div class="section-header">2015</div>
    &hellip;The West <i>did</i> fight back a year later, when they turned the tables quite precisely, going 13-5 in the War just a year after going 5-13. In Pursuit of Perfection scored the <i>second</i> most points in interdivisional history with 378, and no team in the West did worse than 2-1. Remember how I said the East set the high mark for collective points in 2014 with 1,816? Yeah, you can forget that number, because the West put up 1,824 in their 2015 revenge tour.<br/>
    <br/>
    <div class="section-header">Overview</div>
    All in all, in case you lost count, the West holds the all-time advantage in both wins and points, boasting a 56-51-1 record and 258 point edge. Both divisions have claimed the Limousine three times apiece.<br/>
    <br/>
    Now, beyond the War and the three weeks each year it encompasses, which division has actually been stronger in terms of overall points since the Great Split of 2010? That would be the West as well, by a margin of 122.4 points. Over six-plus years and 498 games, that&rsquo;s not a real big difference though: less than a point per game, as a matter of fact. So while the West can undoubtedly lay claim to the War over its first six years of existence, the race remains hotly contested.<br/>
    <br/>
    Isn&rsquo;t it sad, bearing all this in mind, that the West owners <i>still</i> haven&rsquo;t gotten their shit together and procured a physical trophy for their annual champion?<br/>
    <br/>
    Burn.
