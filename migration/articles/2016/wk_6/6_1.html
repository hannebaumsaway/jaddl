    The Bad News Bensons have had a lot of success on the imaginary football field in recent years. They&rsquo;re second in the league in wins since the JADDL was split into divisions. They have more division championships than anyone. No one has averaged more points per game than BNB in the past three years and change.<br/>
    <br/>
    One thing the Bensons haven&rsquo;t done is start a season 5-1. Until now.<br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks to a 128.1&ndash;85.8 interdivisional win over In Pursuit of Perfection, LLC, that&rsquo;s exactly where Bad News sits at the near-midway-point of the season. They also sit atop the East Division. Again. Odell Beckham Jr.&mdash;a man with great hair, better hands, and terrible taste in women&mdash;set the pace with 36 points, which vaulted him up to fourth in the league in points among wide receivers. Spencer Ware seemed unaffected by the return of Jamaal Charles en route to 22 points of his own. Andrew Luck pitched in 23, but he was a cheap rushing touchdown away from another mediocre-to-bad outing, which means quarterback remains a concern for the Bensons going forward.<br/>
    <br/>
    But the concerns are few and far between these days for BNB. They&rsquo;ve scored in the 100s in four out of their six games, more than any other team, and managed to win one of the games where they fell short of that (because they got to play the Longshanks).<br/>
    <br/>
    Like all general managers and coaches, however, it isn&rsquo;t the five wins Alex is focusing on. It&rsquo;s the one loss. A loss which happened to come at the hands of the other 5-1 team in the East: The Mighty Boom. A team the Bensons haven&rsquo;t beaten since the end of 2014.<br/>
    <br/>
    The end of 2014&hellip;the last time, perhaps, Alex felt really good about his franchise. They closed out the regular season with a vengeance win over Boom in Week 13, and then doubled down a week later with an even bigger win over Boom in the quarterfinals. The 156.7 points Bad News scored that day is the second most in playoff history. <i>This is it,</i> Bensons fans thought. <i>We&rsquo;re finally going to win a league title!</i><br/>
    <br/>
    But, as you know, they didn&rsquo;t. Here they are, in 2016, and the largest space allocated in their trophy case remains illusively empty.<br/>
    <br/>
    So the Bensons are still hungry, and it shows. Halfway through the season, they lead the league in points. Will it be enough? Something tells me the fans will no longer be satiated by mere division titles anymore. Those are <i>so</i> 2013.<br/>
    <br/>
    And 2011.<br/>
    <br/>
    And 2010.
