    I still can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s been 10 freaking years. But here we are. Jared Bowl X. That has a nice ring to it, don&rsquo;t you think?<br/>
    <br/>
    To Dan and Alex, Jared Bowl X <em>champion</em> has an even better ring to it.<br/>
    <br/>
    For a season that was filled with quite a bit of drama overall, the end result (to this point) was fairly neat and tidy. The Red Hornets took control of the West Division in Week 10 and never relinquished it, winning Jared&rsquo;s Goblet by a full two games&mdash;a feat not accomplished out west since 2012, when IPA Connoisseur won the division by three games. The Hornets weren&rsquo;t the points leader in the West&mdash;in fact, they were one from the bottom&mdash;but they took care of business in convincing fashion nonetheless, winning five of their last six games and securing that coveted bye.<br/>
    <br/>
    And their triumph in the West Championship game couldn&rsquo;t have been sweeter, since the team they took down (IPP) swept them in the regular season. (And what a bitter pill <em>that</em> must be for Nomac to swallow.)<br/>
    <br/>
	The East told a very different, yet equally impressive, story. The Bensons had to fight and claw to win the division&mdash;<a href="index.php?view=team&id=3" target="_blank">for the <em>fourth time</em></a>, mind you&mdash;despite ending up atop the entire league in points at season&rsquo;s end and only losing two games. Both of those losses were to the East powerhouse, Mighty Boom, the Bensons will attempt to wrestle the crown from this weekend, incidentally. Even with their sterling record, Bad News trailed Lawrence Football Jesus in the standings as recently as Week 11. Those two teams faced off in a game for the ages the following week, however, and the Bensons seized control with an epic 0.6-point victory. <br/>
	<br/>
	And just think how different things could have been had Football Jesus scored just <em>one more point</em> in that game. You can&rsquo;t make this shit up.<br/>
	<br/>
	Had Football Jesus gotten just seven more yards from someone, or a sack from their DST, or something to put them over that tiny hump against the Bensons, Jesus would have won the East (they would have had a better division record than BNB). That means they&rsquo;d have gotten the first round bye, and the Bensons would have had to play Team Odouls.<br/>
	<br/>
	And the Bensons <a href="http://games.espn.com/ffl/boxscorequick?leagueId=244721&teamId=4&scoringPeriodId=14&seasonId=2016&view=scoringperiod&version=quick" target="_blank">would have lost</a>, 77.6&ndash;68.3.<br/>
	<br/>
	Well &hellip; had they actually played that game, Alex probably would have started Odell Beckham, Jr., and LeGarrette Blount, but still, it&rsquo;s more fun to look at the scores as is and marvel at just how damn important that squeaker of a win against LFJ was.<br/>
	<br/>
	But either way, here we stand. Jared Bowl X. A decade of fantasy football excellence has led us to this point.<br/>
	<br/>
	Should the Hornets win, they&rsquo;ll be positively the most enigmatic franchise in ALL OF SPORTS. They&rsquo;d join dynasty The Mighty Boom as the only teams with three titles, and between those titles would be a vast wasteland of suck.<br/>
	<br/>
	The Bensons, on the other hand, are the pre-2004 Boston Red Sox of the JADDL. Racking up division championship after division championship; taking home scoring titles and Torn Hoodies and victories at a consistent clip &hellip; with no league titles to show for it. Alex is Marty Schottenheimer, but one win this weekend changes everything. Suddenly the Bensons would be discussed alongside Boom, not beneath them. Message boards would start discussing, &ldquo;Are the Bensons actually the best franchise in the JADDL?&rdquo; And Alex would go from Marty Schottenheimer to Mike Tomlin or Pete Carroll.<br/>
	<br/>
	A lot at stake. And that&rsquo;s the way it should be. Two division champions, fighting to be <em>the</em> champion.<br/>
	<br/>
	Jared Bowl X-stacy.
