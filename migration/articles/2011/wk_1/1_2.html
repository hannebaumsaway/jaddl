	<div class="game-header">Team Odouls 80.6&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mighty Boom 135.1</div>	Tom Brady <i>daaaaamn!</i> LeSean McCoy <i>daaaamn!</i> Mike Tolbert <i>daaaaamn!</i> Bears D/ST <i>&hellip;damn!</i> Unfortunately for Adam, those are all Boom players. Hey, lookie there: Joe Flacco had a nice day, Odouls.<br>
<br>	<b>Reich&rsquo;s Pick: Boom (+7.5) <span style="color:#55aa55">/WIN</span></b><br>	<div class="pick-revisited">What&rsquo;s to say? Boom is right where he should be, undefeated, atop the standings, and Badass of the week, just like I knew he would be.</div>
<br><br>	<div class="game-header">Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks 87.3&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lawrence Football Jesus 100.3</div>	Good for James, getting this monkey (not you, Tulsa) off his back with a long-awaited victory over the &rsquo;Shanks. This game also marked the first Week 1 loss for the &rsquo;Shanks since the inception of the JADDL. Though Ryan&rsquo;s bench played Ross Perot to his starters&rsquo; George H.W. Bush by scoring 67.3 useless points, 100.3 is plenty to make Trent Dilfer say, &ldquo;James went out and <i>earned</i> this victory.&rdquo;<br>
<br>	<b>Reich&rsquo;s Pick: Longshanks (6.7) <span style="color:#aa5555">/FAIL</span></b><br>	<div class="pick-revisited">What&rsquo;s this? After a D draft grade and no love from the Reich, the Jesus goes out and takes care of business and gets his first win over the dreaded &rsquo;Shanks. Is this the beginning of a new era? A changing of the guard? I still say probably not. Also, it&rsquo;s phonemically nice when Knowshon knowshows.</div>
<br><br>	<div class="game-header">Red Hornets 83.9&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Tulsa Angry Monkeys 100.5</div>	The Flying Pigs didn&rsquo;t eclipse the century mark until Week 11 a year ago, so early returns on the franchise relocation and name change are good. You know what&rsquo;s <i>not</i> good? Dan committing one of the cardinal sins of fantasy football by starting an injured player (Arian Foster). We expect more from one of the League&rsquo;s most prestigious franchises, Dan. Leave that shit back in 2007 with Miller where it belongs. One other note: this had to be ESPN&rsquo;s most accurate spread ever&hellip;
<br><br>	<b>Reich&rsquo;s Pick: Angry Monkeys (-16.3) <span style="color:#55aa55">/WIN</span></b><br>	<div class="pick-revisited">Brandon Llyod, 8.9. Dez Bryant, 13.1 Those 2.2 points were the difference on the Monkey&rsquo;s cover and the saving face on my prediction. Nailed it!</div>
<br><br>	<div class="game-header">The Bad News Bensons 91.9&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Millennium Falcons 75.0</div>	While James finally broke through against Ryan, the beat goes on with Ian getting bent over by big bro Alex. Beyond the continuation of that streak, abso-fuckin&rsquo;-lutely nothing noteworthy came from this matchup.
<br><br>	<b>Reich&rsquo;s Pick: Falcons (-14.9) <span style="color:#aa5555">/FAIL</span></b><br>	<div class="pick-revisited">The real question was how wrong could I be. The poor falcons got -1 from their kicker, less than 10 from their QB and 1.4 from Ochocinco. I was sure wrong about this one. Bensons, 1; Wolfes 0.</div>
<br><br>	<div class="game-header">In Pursuit of Perfection 86.5&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;One Pump Chumps 72.4</div>	Nothing flashy, but IPP&rsquo;s title defense begins with a win. Impressively, that win was acquired despite starting the Chiefs D/ST. I wonder if a healthy Peyton Manning would have surpassed the 6.6 points put up by replacement Donovan McNabb. Hmm&hellip;
<br><br>	<b>Reich&rsquo;s Pick: Chumps (+28.6) <span style="color:#55aa55">/WIN</span></b>
<br>	<div class="pick-revisited">This was a better call than it looked. I know the Chumps didn&rsquo;t win, but Gronkowski&rsquo;s nearly 15 points ensured they beat the spread.</div>
