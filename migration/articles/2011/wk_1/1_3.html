	Daywalker Dan owns one of the most prestigious dynasties in the JADDL, but he has gotten 2011 off to a rough start nonetheless.<br>	<br>	The Red Hornets&rsquo; front office was given a warning by league officials following this past weekend&rsquo;s games. The reason? Starting RB Arian Foster despite the big red "O" next to his name, an indiciation Foster was out for this week&rsquo;s game. Playing an injured player&mdash;thus, giving your team a guaranteed zero from that slot&mdash;is one of the most egregious offenses a fantasy football owner can commit.<br>	<br>	&ldquo;Frankly, the league is sensitive to such acts because it exhibits a lack of dedication to the sport, and to keeping the JADDL the premier fake organization in the country,&rdquo; league commissioner Ryan said in an interview over the weekend.<br>	<br>	The Mighty Boom owner Peter concurred: &ldquo;Moves like that devalue the league, and I find it insulting.&rdquo;<br>	<div class='news-quote'>Freaking game time decisions come early when you are on Mountain Standard Time.<div class='author'>Dan, Hornets owner</div></div><br>	The warning from the league was brief and harsh: &ldquo;While incompetence may be tolerated, indifference will not be. Failure to make obvious and necessary lineup alterations in the future will result in the League taking drastic steps, including (but not limited to) hacking into ESPN&rsquo;s database and changing your franchise name to &lsquo;Upset Underdogs&rsquo;.&rdquo;<br>	<br>	To his credit, Dan was ashamed and apologetic following the warning, though he did attempt to excuse his carelessness.<br>	<br>	&ldquo;Freaking game time decisions come early when you are on Mountain Standard Time. I tried to change it at 9:55 AM, but ESPN already locked me out,&rdquo; said Dan in a statement to the league office. &ldquo;My only saving grace is that I would have lost by a few points even if I had made the switch.&rdquo;<br>	<br>	Excuses out of the way, Dan summed up the situation with one final sentence: &ldquo;Still pretty sad, though, on my part.&rdquo;<br>	<br>	Indeed.
