	It&rsquo;s been quite awhile since The IPA Connoisseur has tasted success along with a sumptuous India Pale Ale. With the lack of action in the win column, a more appropriate moniker would be India <i>Stale</i> Ale. In fact, IPA hasn&rsquo;t had a winning record since Week 11&hellip;of 2009. To put this into perspective, that was November 23rd of that year.<br>	<br>	660 days ago.<br>	<br>	For fuck&rsquo;s sake, Lannie, we know you got married and had a kid in that timeframe, but get your damn priorities straight.<br>	<br>	And so he has. For one week, at least. You can&rsquo;t do much better to start a new season than breaking your franchise record for points scored in a game. Not only did The Connoisseur break its record; it broke it off in Team Hauloll&rsquo;s ass, 134.3&ndash;85.8. The Connoisseur was 1-4 against Hauloll coming into the game.<br>	<br>	Lannie says he tried to reach outward for help on improving his woeful franchise during the long lockout-plagued offseason, but ended up looking inward instead due to lack of available assistance.<br>	<br>	&ldquo;I went to Barnes & Noble to peruse their self-help section, but all I could find was a book called <i>Good to Great</i>,&rdquo; said Lannie. &ldquo;So I researched online, and sure enough, there isn&rsquo;t even a book out there called <i>Shitty to Good</i>. So I did some introspection instead, and said &lsquo;Lannie, quit sucking ass!&rsquo;&rdquo;<br>	<br>	So far so good for the advice from the proverbial man in the mirror. Lannie&rsquo;s meditation led him to believe Matt Hasselbeck could actually get Kenny Britt the ball enough to make him a viable fantasy receiver. Whaddayaknow: five catches, 136 yards, and an 80-yard TD. That equates to 27.6 fantasy points and, combined with Ray Rice&rsquo;s 26.9 and Matt Forte&rsquo;s 23.8, a dominating win over the defending West Division champs.<br>	<br>	And it could have been much worse. Hauloll isn&rsquo;t getting 30 points from Wes Welker on a weekly basis (insert compulsory laughter at the Dolphins&rsquo; secondary). They might get less than 10 points per game from in-danger-of-being-a-has-been DeAngelo Williams and I-don&rsquo;t-do-training-camps Chris Johnson for the next few weeks, however, and that could put them in a big hole.<br>	<div class='news-quote'>All I could find was a book called <span style='font-style:normal;'>Good to Great</span>.&hellip;There isn&rsquo;t even a book out there called <span style='font-style:normal;'>Shitty to Good</span>.<div class='author'>Lannie, IPA Connoisseur owner</div></div><br>	Then again, maybe if kicker Nate Kaeding didn&rsquo;t get hurt at the outset of his game (ha, what?), he could have put up 49 points and we&rsquo;d be lauding Hauloll&rsquo;s continued dominance. Or not. Either way, Jason was in full rationalization mode well before the final whistle.
<br>
<br>	&ldquo;I actually prefer my main guys all have their bad games at the same time if my opponent is going to go off,&rdquo; Jason said in a Gmail Chat conversation with the league commissioner during Monday night&rsquo;s games.
<br>
<br>	An opponent going off has never stopped you from winning in the past, Jason. Getting soft?<br>	<br>	In any case, it&rsquo;s been a year, nine months, and 22 days since The Connoisseur could feel this good about themselves, and the League likes nothing more than a feel-good story. Right, Michael Vick? (Ooo, sorry Alex&hellip;<i>too soon?</i>)

<br>	<b>Reich&rsquo;s Pick: Team Hauloll (+5.9) <span style='color:#aa5555'>/FAIL</span></b>
<br>	<div class='pick-revisited'>The Freeman/McFadden 1-2 punch (a respectable 30 points) had nothing on Hauloll&rsquo;s Rice-Forte-Britt combo at an average 26.1 points a piece. (And that was with Hauloll&rsquo;s Wes Welker throwing down 30&mdash;the highest individual output in the league.) Apparently, the operative word in my pick was &ldquo;seemingly.&rdquo;</div>
