	It&rsquo;s time to get serious about the consolation bracket. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve devised the Anti-Championship for the six-teams who didn&rsquo;t make the JADDL Playoffs. The idea isn&rsquo;t to find out who&rsquo;s the best of the worst, it&rsquo;s to find out who&rsquo;s the worst of the worst. I&rsquo;m sure the Commish would want me to point out at this time that the Anti-Championship is not in anyway sanctioned by the JADDL higher-ups. At least not yet. Also, I will accept bids on the name of this thing. The Anti-Championship is too &ldquo;just the facts&rdquo; for the name of such an awesome tourney. The Bad News Alexes have suggested the &ldquo;Short-Bus Tournament.&rdquo; I think it should be called &ldquo;The DC Football Obama Memorial Classic sponsored by Herman Cain.&rdquo;  <br><br>	The idea is simple, the DCFOMC is like a mirror of the actual JADDL Playoffs. You don&rsquo;t advance by winning, you advance by losing. The best teams don&rsquo;t get byes, the worst teams do. The ultimate &ldquo;winner&rdquo; is the ultimate &ldquo;loser.&rdquo; Only one team can lose their way to dead fucking last, so let&rsquo;s play it out elimination style!<br><br>	Since the matchups will bear out differently than the &ldquo;consolation ladder&rdquo; thing ESPN has crafted, I&rsquo;ve devised a bracket to track how the Anti-Championship is playing out. (NOTE: I&rsquo;ve been out-of-the playoffs more than my share of years, and I have yet to figure out exactly what this &ldquo;consolation ladder&rdquo; determines: it&rsquo;s like some sort of round-robin tourney into nothingness.) You&rsquo;ll notice that the worst teams get home-field advantage, but I&rsquo;m not sure if it should be the other-way around. Anyways, after an exciting Wildcard Round, Adam Jones&rsquo;s Near Beers and Ron Prince&rsquo;s Shell Corporation have earned the opportunity to lose to the worst team in each of their respective divisions, the disgraced Red Hornets and Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks. Here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve got so far:<br>	<br>	<img alt="" src="assets/images/players/2011/consolation_bracket.jpg" /><br>	<br>	How will it play out? Who is the absolute worst team this year? ONLY TIME WILL TELL! IT WON'T BE ME THOUGH!! MY MONEY IS ON IPP!!!!!
