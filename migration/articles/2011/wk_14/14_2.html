	The Tulsa Angry Monkeys (or the Flying Pigs before them) have been a running joke in the JADDL since its inception.<br>	<br>	Four seasons. Zero playoff appearances.<br>	<br>	Hell, even The Lawrence Football Jesus has made the postseason <i>once</i>, at least.<br>	<br>	The Monkeys aren&rsquo;t the worst franchise in the league, based on prestige. The aforementioned Jesus and fellow 2011 upstart IPA Connoisseur both rate below the Mad Apes in that category, as well as all-time winning percentage. But that playoff oh-fer has been an albatross the Monkeys alone have had to bear.<br>	<br>	Until now.<br>	<br>	And it seems Tulsa isn&rsquo;t simply going to be satisfied with finally making the playoffs. They want to stay awhile.<br>	<div class="news-quote">Sure, it&rsquo;s nice to have balanced scoring. Honestly, though, I&rsquo;d rather just have The Rodge put up 70 and be done with it.<div class="author">Jacob</div></div><br>	A convincing 118.7&ndash;103.8 quarterfinal victory over The Connoisseur ensures at least one more week in the mecca of fantasy football. The most encouraging thing for the Monkeys in the win? Aaron All-Everything Rodgers was merely the third leading scorer in the game for Tulsa, behind Larry Fitzgerald and Marshawn &ldquo;Beast Mode&rdquo; Lynch. <br>	<br>	&ldquo;Sure, it&rsquo;s nice to have balanced scoring,&rdquo; said Jacob following the game. &ldquo;Honestly, though, I&rsquo;d rather just have The Rodge put up 70 and be done with it.&rdquo;<br>	<br>	70 may be a stretch, but in 13 games this season, this was Rodgers&rsquo; worst one. In <i>all</i> the others, he scored over 20. He&rsquo;s scored over 30 three times. So, chances are pretty damn good he&rsquo;ll be better in the semis against the patient One Pump Chumps than he was in the quarters.<br>	<br>	The Monkeys better hope so, at least, because the Chumps&rsquo; engine is fueled pretty heavily at the QB slot as well. That fuel is called Cammy Cam Juice. Cam Newton has scored over 20 nine times himself&hellip;over 30 three times, just like Rodgers.<br>	<br>	Something&rsquo;s gotta give. But what will that be? Each team has a top 10 RB; each has a top 10 WR. Hell, both even have top three TEs, though the Chumps&rsquo; Rob &ldquo;STD Commune&rdquo; Gronkowski has a significant points edge over the Monkeys&rsquo; Tony Gonzalez.<br>	<br>	&hellip;What are we doing? We&rsquo;re nitpicking over fucking tight ends?<br>	<br>	The point is, this should be a fantastic game to determine the last man standing in what has been a fantastic division all season.
