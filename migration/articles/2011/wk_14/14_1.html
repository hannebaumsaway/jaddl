	Just when you think you really <i>know</i> somebody&hellip;<br>	<br>	Following Week 9, The Mighty Boom was 3-6, staring playoff elimination squarely in the face. They&rsquo;d only scored over 100 once in the six weeks leading up to that point. Among those scores was a 32.2-point turd, as well; the second lowest scoring total in JADDL history.<br>	<br>	Things were looking grim for The Mighty. Their only saving grace seemed to be the fact that they play in the Least East.<br>	<br>	And the East came through for Boom in the clutch.<br>	<br>	The cursed Longshanks dropped their final three games, Football Jesus was crucified in their must-win regular season finale, and Boom defaulted its way into the postseason despite a losing record (6-7).<br>	<br>	Guess what? None of that means jack shit now. The playoffs have started.<br>	<br>	Not only did Boom start with them, he erased the memory of that 32-point stinker by shattering the single-game playoff scoring record in a 153.7&ndash;112.7 beatdown of the Millennium Falcons. The record was previously held by In Pursuit of Perfection with a 129.5 mark set in the semifinals a year ago.<br>	<br>	The 100-point threshold has been hit 18 times in JADDL playoff history. This is the first time anyone has scored above even 130, let alone 150. To put that into perspective, the Falcons&rsquo; score of 112.7 ranks as the 11th highest playoff score (out of 44 games) in JADDL history. <i>Hey, Falcons, great game! Now sit yo&rsquo; ass down.</i><br>	<br>	Now Pete must hope his team didn&rsquo;t blow its wad prematurely. Getting to the semis has never been a problem for him&hellip;it&rsquo;s getting <i>past</i> them that seems to be the sticking point.<br>	<div class="news-quote">We aren&rsquo;t The Mighty because we win big, we&rsquo;re The Mighty because we win a <span style="font-style:normal;">lot</span>. Also&hellip;we win big.<div class="author">Peter</div></div><br>	2008: lost in the semis.<br>	<br>	2009: lost in the semis.<br>	<br>	2010: lost in the semis.<br>	<br>	I&rsquo;m guessing even the least statistically gifted among you can notice a pattern there. Pete hopes to buck that trend next weekend.<br>	<br>	&ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t The Mighty because we win big,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re The Mighty because we win a <i>lot</i>. Also&hellip;we win big.&rdquo;<br>	<br>	Mighty teams aren&rsquo;t daunted by the semifinals. Mighty teams win championships. 2006 is fading into the background, and it&rsquo;s time to see if this dynamite can finally go Boom again. Ready to snuff out that fuse stand the Bad News Bensons, who are looking to get into the Jared Bowl in consecutive years. Boom and the Bensons split their two matchups in the regular season, with Boom taking the most recent clash in Week 10.
