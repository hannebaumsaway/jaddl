	<i>Jake Gutierrez is the producer and engineer of the world-renowned sports talk radio program, The Border Patrol, on 810 WHB in Kansas City. We pipe Stephania Bell&rsquo;s tweets into the site; Jake talks to her on a weekly basis. He also serves as a statistician for CBS Sports. In other words, he&rsquo;s the perfect freaking guy to grade our fantasy draft. Without further ado&hellip;</i><br>
	<br><br>
	<span class='draft-grade'>A+</span> <span class='draft-team'>The Bad News Bensons</span><br>    Good RB depth, has the 2 best offensive rookies in the game. Expect Brees to have a bounce back year and I think Ahmad Bradshaw will have a huge year. No dominating WR but I like the talent all the way through.<br><br>	<span class='draft-grade'>A</span> <span class='draft-team'>Team Hauloll</span><br>	Love the top 3 RBs. Good QBs but no gamebreaker at WR . <br><br>	<span class='draft-grade'>A-</span> <span class='draft-team'>Millennium Falcons</span><br>	Best RB in the game. I love the Nicks/Jennings combo but no solid #3 WR. <br><br>	<span class='draft-grade'>B+</span> <span class='draft-team'>The IPA Connoisseur</span><br>	Good top 3 RBs, I really like Schaub but very young WRs. If Britt can stay off the weed then this could be a solid WR core. I think Greg Olson could be a sleeper TE.<br><br>	<span class='draft-grade'>B</span> <span class='draft-team'>Team Odouls</span><br>	Almost graded this team down to a D- because of the weak ass team name. Couldn&rsquo;t do it to a team with the best WR in the game. Love Mendenhall; also might have the best D/ST in the Packers. I am a fan of Flacco but I think Daniel Thomas in 6th round is a huge stretch. Must be an EcoKat fan&hellip; <br><br>	<span class='draft-grade'>B-</span> <span class='draft-team'>Red Hornets</span><br>	Good value picks with Benson and Ricky Williams, especially with Foster&rsquo;s health in question. A little early for Romo but I really like Bradford as the backup. If Maclin doesn&rsquo;t have AIDS the WR core has the potential to be really good.<br><br>	<span class='draft-grade'>C+</span> <span class='draft-team'>In Pursuit of Perfection LLC</span><br>	How can I not love Jam Chuck with the 1st pick? And rounds the RB stable with two solid 1st-stringers. Possibly the top WR core in the league with Megatron at the head of the crew. Also has my favorite TE in the league. Jay Cutler worries me with all the INTs he throws but has the potential to be a top 8 guy if he can control the picks. <br><br>	<span class='draft-grade'>C</span> <span class='draft-team'>The Mighty Boom</span><br>	Good starting RBs and 2 solid backups. The name of this team should be changed to &ldquo;The Sleepers.&rdquo; I think Brandon Pettigrew is a huge sleeper and poised to have a big year if Stafford can stay healthy. Also I&rsquo;m a big fan of Roy Helu (even though he is a dumbass Husker). Danny Amendola and Greg Little are solid late picks and have the potential to be big players. This team has the best WRs top to bottom. If you need WRs later in the season this is the guy you should be sending trades to. <br><br>	<span class='draft-grade'>C-</span> <span class='draft-team'>Tulsa Angry Monkeys</span><br>	Best QB in the game but in a league that only gets 4 points for Pass TDs the value of the QB drops slightly. Love the 1st four picks but after that the draft fell off. No legit #2 RB and I think by the end of the year the law firm BGE won&rsquo;t be starting for the Pats. Vernon Davis is a top 3 TE but Tulsa will depend on a crappy 49ers team for 2 of his 9 starting spots.<br><br>	<span class='draft-grade'>D</span> <span class='draft-team'>Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks</span><br>	Hate Ryan Mathews and lukewarm on Knowshon Moreno. Roddy White is solid but Brandon Marshall and Steve Smith are #3 fantasy WRs. Has the top Kicker in the league though&hellip;<br><br>	<span class='draft-grade'>D</span> <span class='draft-team'>The Lawrence Football Jesus</span><br>	Not a Vick fan especially in the 1st round of a league that only gives 4 points for Passing TDs and then to waste a middle round pick with a back-up QB is why this team earned a D. This ream does have 2 solid RBs but LT is worthless and past his prime. Is going to be in trouble when Blount and Wells are on bye weeks. Might have the best TE in the league but that&rsquo;s about it.<br><br>	<span class='draft-grade'>F</span> <span class='draft-team'>One Pump Chumps</span><br>	This grade was given before Manning was even ruled out but after that news it should be a F-. Very down on MJD and you should probably drop Rashad Jennings considering he is on IR. With 8 guys in the box Jacksonville will struggle to run the ball. Your 2nd drafted RB is a back-up. Starting McNabb is not a good thing. About the only thing I like about this team is Reggie Bush. I think he is going to have a big year.
