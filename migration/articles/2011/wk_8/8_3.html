	You guys were sent out a questionnaire in the interests of letting your fellow owners peek into your soul a bit. Last week you <a href="news/2011/wk_8/index.php?view=news&amp;yr=2011&amp;wk=7&amp;pg=3">learned more about your comrades in the East</a>. This week, it&rsquo;s the currently-superior division&rsquo;s turn. The answers are given in the order I received them. Enjoy the insight into the Wild Wild West&hellip;<br>	<br>	<span style="color:#7777aa"><div class="section-head">Who&rsquo;s your primary rival?</div></span><br>	<b>Jacob:</b> Longshanks, because I&rsquo;ve known Ryan the longest and it&rsquo;s one of the more kickass names.<br>	<br>	<b>Lannie:</b> I would have to say either Nolan or Peter, but that&rsquo;s mostly because I know them the best and used to see them both on a weekly basis. Now that Peter is in Squawk-land, I don&rsquo;t see him too often, but I still see Nolan and we almost always discuss a little fantasy football when in season. Surprisingly, both Peter and Nolan are also my closest &ldquo;true&rdquo; rivals based on win/loss records since I&rsquo;ve been a part of the JADDL. I&rsquo;m 4-3 against Nolan and 2-3 against Boom.<br>	<br>	<b>Jason:</b> Uhhhh good question&hellip;but based on record alone I&rsquo;ve had the most difficulty beating the Bensons and Longshanks. I would consider a rival someone you want to lose week in and week out and I only do that for those above me in the standings.<br>	<br>	<b>Jesse:</b> IPP. I believe I&rsquo;m around .500 against him and he knocked me out of the playoffs last year, as well as being 1 of my 2 losses this year.<br>	<br>	<b>Dan:</b> No idea, but I&rsquo;ll go with Jason since he is also in Phx and sitting next to me right now.<br>	<br>	<b>Nolan:</b> Lannie due to location and Boom, because to be the best you have to beat the best. (I am sure I do not show up on his rivalry radar.)<br>	<br>	<span style="color:#7777aa"><div class="section-head">Do you like divisions?</div></span><br>	All &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; votes.<br>	<br>	<span style="color:#7777aa"><div class="section-head">What&rsquo;s the meaning behind your franchise name?</div></span><br>	<b>Jacob:</b> I used to have the Flying Pigs as a play on words. On one hand, I would only win if Pigs could fly, but on the other hand, every Sunday and Monday night a &ldquo;pigskin&rdquo; flew around in the air; just so happens it always landed in my opponent&rsquo;s arms. I changed over to the Tulsa Angry Monkeys to get away from the pink, add a much-needed fear component, and&hellip;I love monkeys.
<br>	
<br>	<b>Lannie:</b> I think my name is pretty self-explanatory. I happen to be an avid beer drinker, and my personal favorite type of beer is the IPA or &ldquo;India Pale Ale.&rdquo; I just enjoy the refreshing hoppy bitter taste it provides&hellip;the alcohol content is nice as well [smiley face]. I recently enjoyed many different IPAs at the 11th annual Midwest Beerfest here in Wichita this past weekend. An event Peter and I both used to attend before his departure from Ta-town.
<br>
<br>	My first name was Mr. Mclovin, only because the movie <i>Superbad</i> was fresh out at the time and mostly for a lack of originality. I then changed to the IPA Guzzlers, which supports my love for IPA but still wasn&rsquo;t quite right &rsquo;cause you should enjoy an IPA and not guzzle it.
<br>	
<br>	<b>Jason:</b> It&rsquo;s named after Landoll Corp.&rsquo;s heavy haul trailer&mdash;haulall&hellip;which I guess I&rsquo;ve spelled wrong all along. Never considered a name change but I may have to now to correct the spelling.
<br>	
<br>	<b>Jesse:</b> When I made the name, I was living in Aggieville, and I was truly a One Pump Chump. Bringing home what I could and getting her out just as quick.
<br>	
<br>	<b>Dan:</b> Earned the nickname after turning bright red during squats in high school.
<br>	
<br>	<b>Nolan:</b> I have had a number of different names (&rsquo;Ta Tweeners, Nomac&rsquo;s Nomads) even dating back to Dorothy Mantooth at the league&rsquo;s inception. I have been IPP for the last couple years. In Pursuit of Perfection is the name of the Ron Prince shell company used to funnel money away from KSU with the help of Bob &ldquo;Art Major&rdquo; Krause, the old A.D. My franchise was going through some difficult years, just as the RP years were difficult too. I figured if Prince could dream of perfection why not me!<br>	<br>	<span style="color:#7777aa"><div class="section-head">Do you care more about your favorite NFL team or your JADDL team?</div></span><br>	<b>Jacob:</b> Oooooo. I have to go with the Pack just because they seem to have a better chance of winning on Sundays and actually get hardware, but this season I am sporting a winning record and have felt that tingling sensation through my body that I haven&rsquo;t felt since I found out what beer tasted like.
<br>	
<br>	<b>Lannie:</b> I definitely care more about my JADDL team [smiley face]. I recently picked up the NFL RedZone channel from my cable provider and watch that most Sundays rather than just the plain Chiefs game. It&rsquo;s a pretty sweet channel for following fantasy football considering they basically only show scoring plays for any team in the league at the time.
<br>	
<br>	<b>Jason:</b> Depends on the season and how good the Chiefs are&hellip;like this year I will gladly cheer for my players when they play the Chiefs. This was unheard of and Jason of 10 years ago would kick my ass for this.
<br>	
<br>	<b>Jesse:</b> I&rsquo;m selfish and ALL about my fantasy team!
<br>	
<br>	<b>Dan:</b> JADDL by far, then KSU, then the Big 12, then the NFL.
<br>	
<br>	<b>Nolan:</b> Both IPP and the Chiefs about the same, which is why I almost always have one on my team. JACKIE BATTLE last night for instance made it really easy to root for the Chiefs.<br>	<br>	<span style="color:#7777aa"><div class="section-head">Do you use outside sources for start/sit, waiver wire, and/or trade ideas?</div></span><br>	<b>Jacob:</b> Not really, just whatever information I get off reading/watching ESPN.
<br>	
<br>	<b>Lannie:</b> I might occassionally use an outside source to see what they are suggesting, but I mostly just go off player stats / weekly match-up / ESPN projections to make my moves. I am a lot more active on the waiver wire these past few seasons than I ever used to be. I guess I chalk that up to getting more accustomed to fantasy football and my increased interest with each year in the JADDL.
<br>	
<br>	<b>Jason:</b> No. Might catch a tip watching that ESPN guy every once in awhile&hellip;otherwise will just consult a friend at home if I&rsquo;m stuck on a decision.
<br>	
<br>	<b>Jesse:</b> I just use ESPN. Occassionally I&rsquo;ll see what Yahoo! Sports has to say. Glued to CBS from 11 to noon.
<br>	
<br>	<b>Dan:</b> Not at all, sheer red-headed luck or lack thereof drives the Hornets.
<br>	
<br>	<b>Nolan:</b> I will read the email ESPN sends out, and occassionally look at some other pages they have too. Drafting I usually will visit a variety of sites.<br>	<br>	<span style="color:#7777aa"><div class="section-head">Your favorite moment as a fantasy football GM?</div></span><br>	<b>Jacob:</b> Not sure the exact moment, but any time you are a multiple digit underdog playing one of the top franchises and you pull out an upset, and you just know that the other guy is thinking, &ldquo;Oh sure, the one week he plays great it&rsquo;s against me.&rdquo; Just feels good to take down the big dog once in awhile.
<br>	
<br>	<b>Lannie:</b> I don&rsquo;t know that I have a favorite moment per se. I do really enjoy when I go to check my fantasy football team on a Sunday from either my phone or computer to find out I&rsquo;m crushing my opponent. That is always a good feeling. Or when you know you basically have the game won even before all of your players have played. I always enjoy the draft as well as it is the start of a new FF season with all the possibilities that go along with it.
<br>	
<br>	<b>Jason:</b> Winning it all, baby.
<br>	
<br>	<b>Jesse:</b> When I realized I had WON IT ALL a few years back! I rode Shaun Alexander that WHOLE season!
<br>	
<br>	<b>Dan:</b> Winning my second title.
<br>	
<br>	<b>Nolan:</b> Tanking Week 1 last season. My God-awful performance gave me the #2 waiver wire position. Luckily, Adam did not place a bid on the reformed Mr. Vick. I rode that defeat all the way to the championship last season.<br>	<br>	<span style="color:#7777aa"><div class="section-head">Your worst moment as a GM?</div></span><br>	<b>Jacob:</b> It wasn&rsquo;t in this league but in another. Last year I made it to the playoffs in my work league (yeah, that&rsquo;s right, I have been to the postseason before&hellip;consider this like playing in the Canadian League). I was facing off with my former boss who had just fired me a few weeks prior, and it was time for me to kick some ass; only my team decided to suck donkey dick and I lost by more than 30 points. Asshole!
<br>	
<br>	<b>Lannie:</b> Probably my 3-10 season last year or also in 2008. I definitely haven&rsquo;t been a perennial powerhouse in the JADDL but I&rsquo;m working to change that. Not making the playoffs just sucks.
<br>	
<br>	<b>Jason:</b> Nothing really stands out. Made the playoffs every year. Maybe the injuries that happened to my team late in the season last year that cost me the chance at another championship after rolling the whole season.
<br>	
<br>	<b>Jesse:</b> Having the 2nd best record in the league in 2009 with a bye and losing in the semis.
<br>	
<br>	<b>Dan:</b> Starting this season 0-6.
<br>	
<br>	<b>Nolan:</b> Jamal Charles blowing his knee out by the Detroit Lions&rsquo; mascot.<br>	<br>	<span style="color:#7777aa"><div class="section-head">What would your franchise&rsquo;s stadium be named?</div></span><br>	<b>Jacob:</b> It would probably be sponsored by some shitty Tulsa corporation like Dollar Thrifty, but the stadium&rsquo;s nickname would be &ldquo;The Zoo&rdquo; and people would dress up like animals for the games. There would be a huge cage with actual animals and everything.
<br>	
<br>	<b>Lannie:</b> Down the Hatch Stadium.
<br>	
<br>	<b>Jason:</b> The Kingdom.
<br>	
<br>	<b>Jesse:</b> Keystone Stadium, because I&rsquo;m usually drinking Keystone Light during all the NFL games I&rsquo;m watching.
<br>	
<br>	<b>Dan:</b> Daywalker Thunderdome.
<br>	
<br>	<b>Nolan:</b> The Ron Prince Stomp&rsquo;n Grounds. The LED ribbon would have his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJABCXZUbzM" target="_blank">signature stomp</a> on a continual loop around the stadium.<br>	<br>	<span style="color:#7777aa"><div class="section-head">Favorite Movie(s)?</div></span><br>	<b>Jacob:</b> <i>The Matrix</i>.
<br>	
<br>	<b>Lannie:</b> I&rsquo;m a pretty big fan of 80s movies and I think <i>Top Gun</i> would get my #1 vote. Maverick and Goose, bitches&hellip;
<br>	
<br>	<b>Jason:</b> <i>Backdoor Sluts 9</i>.
<br>	
<br>	<b>Dan:</b> <i>Love Actually</i>.
<br>	
<br>	<span style="color:#7777aa"><div class="section-head">What&rsquo;s the funniest YouTube vid you&rsquo;ve seen (ever or recently)?</div></span><br>	<b>Jacob:</b> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzZXOSQ5GjE" target="_blank">Cupcake eating challenge ends badly</a>.
<br>	
<br>	<b>Lannie:</b> I find the <a href="http://www.epicmealtime.com/videos/" target="_blank">EpicMealTime videos</a> to be pretty funny although gross at the same time.
<br>	
<br>	<b>Jason:</b> I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;ve seen too many on <i>Tosh.0</i> to pick just one.
<br>	
<br>	<b>Dan:</b> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1Y73sPHKxw" target="_blank">Dramatic Chipmunk</a>, old but classic.
<br>	
<br>	<span style="color:#7777aa"><div class="section-head">Favorite Book(s)?</div></span><br>	<b>Jacob:</b> <i>Monster</i> by Frank Peretti.
<br>	
<br>	<b>Lannie:</b> Don&rsquo;t think I have a favorite. My favorite series right now are &ldquo;The Wheel of Time&rdquo; by Robert Jordan, &ldquo;A Song of Ice and Fire&rdquo; by George R. R. Martin, &ldquo;The Inheritence Cycle&rdquo; by Christopher Paolini, &ldquo;Harry Potter&rdquo; by J.K. Rowling, and &ldquo;The Lord of the Rings&rdquo; + <i>The Hobbit</i> by J.R.R. Tolkien.
<br>	
<br>	<b>Jason:</b> <i>Angels & Demons</i>.
<br>	
<br>	<b>Dan:</b> Right now, anything but a textbook.
<br>	
<br>	<span style="color:#7777aa"><div class="section-head">What speech would you use to fire your team up before a Jared Bowl?</div></span><br>	<b>Jacob:</b> &ldquo;Never, never, never give up.&rdquo; &ndash;Winston Churchill
<br>	
<br>	<b>Lannie:</b> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyEVXUSCYcg" target="_blank">Al Pacino&rsquo;s speech in <i>Any Given Sunday</i></a>.
<br>	
<br>	<b>Jason:</b> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyEVXUSCYcg" target="_blank">Al Pacino&rsquo;s speech in <i>Any Given Sunday</i></a>.
<br>	
<br>	<b>Dan:</b> I was also going to go with Bobby Knight vs. Purdue.
<br>	
<br>	<span style="color:#7777aa"><div class="section-head">Boxers or briefs?</div></span><br>	Boxers: Jacob, Lannie, Dan<br>	Boxer-briefs: Jason<br>	<br>	<span style="color:#7777aa"><div class="section-head">Favorite ice cream flavor?</div></span><br>	<b>Jacob:</b> Chunky Monkey from Ben & Jerry&rsquo;s. That&rsquo;s serious; the monkey thing is just a coincidence.
<br>	
<br>	<b>Lannie:</b> Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough&hellip;pure awesome.
<br>	
<br>	<b>Jason:</b> Strawberry.
<br>	
<br>	<b>Dan:</b> Birthday Cake Remix at Coldstone.
<br>	
<br>	<span style="color:#7777aa"><div class="section-head">Ice cream or cake?</div></span><br>	Cake: Dan<br>	Ice cream: Jacob, Lannie, Jason<br>	<br>	<span style="color:#7777aa"><div class="section-head">Cake or pie?</div></span><br>	Everyone chose pie. Dan chose both.<br>	<br>	<span style="color:#7777aa"><div class="section-head">What type of pizza do you go for?</div></span><br>	<b>Jacob:</b> Mediterranean.
<br>	
<br>	<b>Lannie:</b> I like most toppings but if I had to pick a favorite I&rsquo;d probably go with a hamburger/mushroom/jalapenos combo. Gotta spice it up a bit.
<br>	
<br>	<b>Jason:</b> Ham, jalapeno, pineapple, and green pepper&hellip;on thin &rsquo;n&rsquo; crispy.
<br>	
<br>	<b>Dan:</b> Sausage and Banana Peppers.
<br>	
<br>	<span style="color:#7777aa"><div class="section-head">Winter or Summer?</div></span><br>	Winter: Jason, Dan (in AZ)<br>	Summer: Jacob, Dan (in CO)
<br>	Fall: Lannie<br>	<br>	<span style="color:#7777aa"><div class="section-head">Political party?</div></span><br>	<b>Jacob:</b> Republican, but I&rsquo;ve never voted.
<br>	
<br>	<b>Lannie:</b> Probably Republican&hellip;not real big into politics though.
<br>	
<br>	<b>Jason:</b> Pretty much independent now&hellip;gave up on both parties.
<br>	
<br>	<b>Dan:</b> Libertarian, but I enjoy listening to the insane, irrational comments by the GOP candidates.
<br>	
<br>	<span style="color:#7777aa"><div class="section-head">Bowl season or March Madness?</div></span><br>	<b>Jacob:</b> Son of a bitch! &hellip;I&rsquo;m going to go with bowl season.
<br>	
<br>	<b>Lannie:</b> Bowl season is fun especially if K-State is playing in one, but March Madness wins hands down here. I don&rsquo;t think anything can compete with its fast paced excitement where anything is possible since it&rsquo;s an actual F&rsquo;ing tournament. Now if the bowl season had some kind of tournament then I don&rsquo;t know what my choice would be&hellip;
<br>	
<br>	<b>Jason:</b> Tough&hellip;March Madness by a hair now that K-State makes the tournament.
<br>	
<br>	<b>Dan:</b> March Madness.
