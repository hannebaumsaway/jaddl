	Man, the parallels between The Lawrence Football Jesus and The Bethlehem Christian Jesus were practically set up on a tee for this article.<br>	<br>	Actual Jesus turned water into wine, right? Well, Football Jesus turned Beanie Wells into a really good fantasy producer during a 3-1 start.<br>	<br>	Actual Jesus healed the sick. Football Jesus brought LaDainian Tomlinson back from the brink of oblivion to score 21.4 improbable points in a Week 3 win when no one else on the LFJ roster did anything.<br>	<br>	Actual Jesus was dead for roughly three days (he rose &ldquo;on the third day&rdquo;&hellip;a bit vague, and I&rsquo;m rounding up). Now, Football Jesus is attempting to resurrect its season after being dead for three straight games, averaging just 61 points per game over that bleak 0-3 stretch.<br>	<br>	This past weekend was a good first step&mdash;potentially the rolling away of the stone at the entrance to the tomb, if you will. Football Jesus got back to .500 behind a solid performance from its second-string QB, &ldquo;Big&rdquo; Ben Roethlisberger (20.7 points). Beanie &ldquo;Water to Wine&rdquo; Wells pitched in 14.3 and Big Ben&rsquo;s IRL teammate Antonio Brown contributed another 12.7 in a 95.3&ndash;89.9 victory over the One Pump Chumps, who were hot! hot! hot! coming into the weekend.<br>	<br>	<i>The Da Vinci Code</i> would have us believe Actual Jesus married Mary Magdalene. The Catholic church says Magdalene was a hooker. Given Big Ben&rsquo;s sketchy history when it comes to women, he has undoubtedly dabbled in the seedy world of prostitution&mdash;whether he bought them or beat them is anyone&rsquo;s guess.<br>	<br>	Therefore, ergo, ipso facto, a parallel can be drawn between Actual Jesus and Football Jesus player Ben Roethlisberger. Just go with it.<br>	<div class='news-quote'>Honestly, who would pit the <span style="font-style:normal;">Saints</span> against Jesus?<div class='author'>James</div></div><br>	In case I haven&rsquo;t provided enough eerie comparisons, here&rsquo;s one more. Actual Jesus was a carpenter, right? You know, when he wasn&rsquo;t running around as the Messiah, he was building vanities and donkeyhouses and such. Well, carpenters frequently <i>sand</i> things. In a last minute roster change, Football Jesus inserted Emmanuel <i>Sanders</i> into the starting lineup. Tell me that&rsquo;s not hard-hitting journalism right there!<br>	<br>	<i>Pause for applause&hellip;</i><br>	<br>	James stopped short of claiming any sort of grand scheme behind all these parallels, but did offer up insight into his team&rsquo;s psyche along a similar vein.<br>	<br>	&ldquo;When we saw Jesse was starting the Saints D/ST against us, that provided some extra motivation for my guys. I mean, honestly, who would pit the <i>Saints</i> against Jesus?&rdquo;<br>	<br>	Likely no one from here on out, considering the outcome. The Saints D/ST itself scored right at its average (5), but the bad karma caught up with Saints receiver Marques Colston, who was also held to 5 after scoring 17.8 and 21.8 in his previous two games.<br>	<br>	Asked how he could have overlooked such a blatant misstep in the game of cosmic energy, Jesse simply said, &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t paying enough attention, the World Series was on!&rdquo;
<br>
<br>	Whatever the fuck the &ldquo;World Series&rdquo; is&hellip;
<br>
<br>	Anyway, Jesus (the Football variety) suddenly finds itself in second place in the meek East despite its previous three-game skid, and if Jesus (the Actual variety) taught us anything&hellip;
<br>
<br>	The meek shall inherit the League.
