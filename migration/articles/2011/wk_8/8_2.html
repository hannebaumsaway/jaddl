	<div class="game-header">The Mighty Boom 106.6&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Red Hornets 110.8</div>	Who saw <i>this</i> coming? Not only have the &rsquo;Nets won two in a row; they put up an impressive score to do so. It was necessary, too, as Boom finally woke up from its Bust to score in the 100s for the first time since Week 3. The Bust continues in another fashion, however, as Pete has now lost three straight.

<br><br>	<div class="game-header">In Pursuit of Perfection 93.1&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks 93.1</div>	So, as I write this, I realize ESPN gave the &rsquo;Shanks one extra point on Wednesday night. So, instead of writing about an excrutiating &rsquo;Shanks loss, this is about an excrutiating tie for both teams. The &rsquo;Shanks had the game in the bag until Philip Rivers inexplicably dropped a snap on MNF. Rivers, by the way, had just gotten benched by the &rsquo;Shanks&hellip;coincidence? That drop sent the game into OT, where Jackie Battle racked up the necessary yardage to beat&mdash;er, tie&mdash;the &rsquo;Shanks. &rsquo;Shanks RB Ryan Matthews was sidelined late in the game with a mysterious &ldquo;groin injury&rdquo; that somehow allowed him to still walk around begging to go back in the game. One of the most bizarre fantasy football games you will ever see, made even more so by the late adjustment leading to a tie&hellip;the first tie since the JADDL went to fractional scoring.

<br><br>	<div class="game-header">The IPA Connoisseur 115.1&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Team Odouls 58.7</div>	IPA just keeps on truckin&rsquo;. Moral victory for Odouls: they would have won by 1.1 had IPA&rsquo;s score been cut in half. &hellip;Nevermind, that isn&rsquo;t even a moral victory. That&rsquo;s an ass-whoopin&rsquo;.

<br><br>	<div class="game-header">Millennium Falcons 89.5&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Team Hauloll 66.7</div>	When Matthew Stafford gives you 28.7 points, you feel good about your chances. When Matthew Stafford accounts for 43% of your total scoring, you feel pretty damn awful about your chances, as Jason surely did. Ian made up for those 28 points with Adrian Peterson and got enough help from Elisabeth Hasselbeck&rsquo;s no-talent assclown husband and Eric Decker for a fairly comfortable win to get back to .500. The main story from this game: what on earth is wrong with Team Hauloll? They haven&rsquo;t scored in triple figures since Week 4, and haven&rsquo;t even eclipsed 70 in their past two outings. Not very Hauloll-like.

<br><br>	<div class="game-header">Tulsa Angry Monkeys 69.8&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Bad News Bensons 71.7</div>	Bad News was in the right place at the right time. The place was facing off with the Monkeys. The time was Aaron Rodgers&rsquo; bye. With Rodgers in play, no way 71.7 gets it done. Without him, Dwayne Bowe nullified <i>just</i> enough of Matt Cassel&rsquo;s points for Alex to eek out the dubya. The Monkeys missed a golden opportunity to somehow keep pace with The Connoisseur without Rodgers.
