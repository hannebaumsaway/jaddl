	<div class="game-header">Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks 114.3&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mighty Boom 128.4</div>	Rule #17 of JADDL play: never waste a big week against The Boom. Because Boom is happy to whip it out upon a challenge, and his is almost always bigger than yours. Austin Miles may have left the game with an injury, but not before he put up 34.1 to stave off the &rsquo;Shanks.<br>
<br>	<b>Reich&rsquo;s Pick: Boom (-8.4) <span style="color:#55aa55">/WIN</span></b><br>	<div class="pick-revisited">No surprises here. In fact the Boom is sitting in its thrown atop the East having quietly just had the best JADDL season start ever, going 2-0 and averaging over 131 points through the first two contests. Note to the Shanks: Don&rsquo;t waste your points playing the Boom.</div>
<br><br>	<div class="game-header">In Pursuit of Perfection 90.5&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Team Hauloll 123.0</div>	<i>There&rsquo;s</i> the Hauloll we all know and other West owners hate. Darren McFadden did what Darren McFadden does, but aside from him and Mike Wallace, the skill position players in this game were supremely subpar. What kept the total score respectable was the insane fact that the teams&rsquo; kickers and defenses combined for <i>60 points</i>.<br>
<br>	<b>Reich&rsquo;s Pick: IPP (-5.3) <span style="color:#aa5555">/FAIL</span></b><br>	<div class="pick-revisited">Team Hauloll also ran the play-whoever-is-playing-KC train, getting almost 26 points out of Matt Stafford. They also got 35 points from special teams (D+K), to make up for four of their position players putting up single digits. That&rsquo;s kinda weird, isn&rsquo;t it?</div>
<br><br>	<div class="game-header">Team Odouls 106.0&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Millennium Falcons 106.7</div>	This is what the JADDL is all about. Well, besides the money and godlike prestige, of course. A game that wasn&rsquo;t settled until the MNF clock hit zeros (and doubtlessly Ian was sweating it out until Tuesday morning when the points were finalized), each team had studs and duds in the starting lineup. The bench tells a sad story, however, as Odouls let Devery Henderson&rsquo;s 18.3 points waste away while DeSean Jackson put up 2.1.
<br><br>	<b>Reich&rsquo;s Pick: Falcons (+10.9) <span style="color:#55aa55">/WIN</span></b><br>	<div class="pick-revisited">The Falcons weren&rsquo;t content with a mere cover here, egging out Odouls by less than a point.</div>
<br><br>	<div class="game-header">The Lawrence Football Jesus 81.7&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Bad News Bensons 127.0</div>	The Bensons had three positions produce over 20 points (four over 15), and The Jesus had none. Kudos to LeGarrette &ldquo;The Cigarette&rdquo; Blount for showing up this week in a losing effort, however; that is a good sign for The Jesus&rsquo; long-term prospects. Alex has backed up that A+ draft rating so far.
<br><br>	<b>Reich&rsquo;s Pick: Bensons (+3.5) <span style="color:#55aa55">/WIN</span></b><br>	<div class="pick-revisited">The Bensons looked like they want to be the best team in the East. If Peyton Hillisis putting up 20 points a pop, they might be close. Of course having the D/ST of the Chiefs &ldquo;opponent&rdquo; is like starting an extra star starting quarterback. In facts the Lions D/ST outscored everyone on his team save Drew Brees.</div>
<br><br>	<div class="game-header">Tulsa Angry Monkeys 93.0&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;The IPA Connoisseur 115.7</div>	Damn, if IPA keeps this shit up, we&rsquo;ll have to stop making fun of them. That would suck, and kill at least half the content of the newsletters. By the way, Reich, what is IPA trying to &ldquo;repeat,&rdquo; exactly? They went 3-10 last year. Thinking of IP<i>P,</i> perhaps?
<br><br>	<b>Reich&rsquo;s Pick: Monkeys (-6.0) <span style="color:#aa5555">/FAIL</span></b>
<br>	<div class="pick-revisited">I was wrong, wrong, wrong about this one. IPA and the Terrible Three&mdash;Rice, Forte and Turner&mdash;wacked up a thin Monkeys squad (who got 2.8 points total out of their D/ST and two position players (wingback + WR)), completing the second-best season start ever, with 125 per through two weeks. (They narrowly edged out Boom&rsquo;s historic 2009 campaign, where the Mighty put up 116.2 and 132.9 to start the season.) IPA is apparently serious about repeating. All that said, I still won my UNDER bet.</div>
