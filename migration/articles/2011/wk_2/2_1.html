	Well, Jake Gutierrez, looks like the One Pump Chumps aren&rsquo;t going to simply sit back and let you F them in the A with your F rating.<br>	<br>	After it looked like the Chumps <i>would</i> do just that in Week 1, posting the league&rsquo;s lowest score, they rebounded with a vengeance in Week 2, taking home the Briefly Badass award with a 132.1&ndash;77.6 F&rsquo;ing of the scuffling Red Hornets. The scoring firm of Jackson & Jackson led the way for OPC; WR Vincent Jackson with 29.2, followed closely by RB Fred Jackson with 28.<br>	<br>	Former Mizzou-rah standout Jeremy Maclin did his best to put the sting back in the Hornets (0-2) by matching Vincent Jackson&rsquo;s 29.2-point output, and Tony &ldquo;Hey look, I&rsquo;m kinda hurt again!&rdquo; Romo crawled heroically back onto the field and threw up 23.8, but that&rsquo;s where the good news ends for the &rsquo;Nets. Austin Collie, with a Kerry Collins-shaped albatross around his neck, only managed 2.4, which was hilariously 4.2 points <i>more</i> than Ricky Williams scored.<br>	<br>	Scored? More like deducted. And he wasn&rsquo;t alone. The Bills D/ST surpassed Slicky Ricky&rsquo;s output&mdash;in the wrong direction&mdash;with -3.<br>	<br>	Dan could not be reached for comment. His secretary said he was out for dinner&hellip;while the rest of the league slept. You know: Mountain Time.<br>	<br>	Back to the team of the hour, the sizeable win vaulted the Chumps (1-1) up to an early third place position in the JADDL West.<br>	<div class='news-quote'>It&rsquo;s early, but I feel pretty confident we&rsquo;re going to shove that draft grade right up Jake Gutierrez&rsquo;s ass.<div class='author'>Jesse, Chumps owner</div></div><br>	&ldquo;It&rsquo;s early, but I feel pretty confident we&rsquo;re going to shove that draft grade right up Jake Gutierrez&rsquo;s ass,&rdquo; said Jesse. &ldquo;And our two-star prestige rating is a slap in my face, and there&rsquo;s only one thing to do about it&hellip;<br>	<br>	&ldquo;Win the whole&hellip;fuckin&rsquo;&hellip;thing.&rdquo;<br>	<br>	Easier said than done, however, when you&rsquo;ve got Donovan McNabb leading your huddle while Peyton Manning and his laser, rocket arm ride the long, hard road to recovery. But hey: Trent fucking Dilfer won a Super Bowl. Clearly, <i>anything</i> is possible.

<br>	<b>Reich&rsquo;s Pick: Chumps (-6.4) <span style="color:#55aa55">/WIN</span></b>
<br>	<div class="pick-revisited">It&rsquo;s been a rough couple a weeks for Mountain Time. Six weeks till Daylight Savings Time ends. Oh wait, Arizona doesn&rsquo;t do that. Something&rsquo;s gotta give, Dan-O, or it&rsquo;s gonna be a long season for the Hornets.</div>
