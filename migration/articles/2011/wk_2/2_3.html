	In the words of Millennium Falcons receiver Chad Ochocinco:<br>	<br>	Fuckin&rsquo; wow.<br>	<br>	Scoring records are being shattered left and right in this young season. Clearly, JADDL players didn&rsquo;t jack around during their vacation prolonged by the NFL lockout. And it&rsquo;s not just the skill position players, either. Oft-unsung D/STs are putting up points in bunches as well. It&rsquo;s as if the league as a whole was infused with Cammy Cam juice, and they likey.<br>	<br>	League-wide, the previous high mark for total points scored through Week 2&mdash;2,394 in 2007&mdash;was eclipsed by the 2,429.6 tally put up this year.<br>	<br>	That charge was led by&mdash;who else?&mdash;The Mighty Boom, which utterly destroyed the individual team Week 2 record total with 263.5. The former occupant of the top spot was also Boom (again, <i>who the fuck else would it be?</i>) with 249.1 in &rsquo;09.<br>	<br>	As you may have noticed&mdash;or <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/JADDL_Commish/status/116333769123831808">would have heard</a> if you follow @JADDL_Commish on Twitter&mdash;that 249.1 score was eclipsed this year not only by Boom, but by The IPA Connoisseur as well. In other words, 2011 now occupies the top <i>two</i> spots on this completely irrelevant page of the record books.<br>	<br>	&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fantastic,&rdquo; said JADDL Commissioner Ryan. &ldquo;It just shows how much these individuals <i>live</i> for fantasy football. So really, it&rsquo;s pretty sad. But&hellip;still fantastic. Fantastically sad.&rdquo;<br>	<br>	Sad?<br>	<br>	Child, please.
