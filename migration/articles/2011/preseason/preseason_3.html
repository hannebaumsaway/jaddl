	<i>Turn and face the strain.</i><br>	<br>	David Bowie had that shit right.<br>	<br>	Like an aging actress, the JADDL is striving to keep up with revolutions in the fantasy football world. Last year brought the advent of divisions, fulfilling James&rsquo; long-awaited dream of finishing last in a division rather than the league as a whole. It also brought with it a brand spankin&rsquo; new website to showcase the league in all its glory, supplanting the previous communication method of a shared DropBox folder and a slew of Microsoft Word docs. We knew we could do better than a system perfectly suited for Windows 98 and a 56k modem.<br>	<br>	And so we have.<br>	<br>	2011 introduces a completely reimagined site, built from the ground up as a cleaner, more robust, better functioning portal into the JADDL world. You still get your standard newsletters (if you haven&rsquo;t figured that out while reading this newsletter, you&rsquo;re a moron), a scoreboard that would rout ESPN&rsquo;s in a beauty contest, accurate standings, and individual franchise pages. But now you also get a live Twitter feed, pouring information relevant to the JADDL into your brain quicker than you can process it; insanely in-depth historical statistics about each franchise and the league as a whole (for example, did you know Football Jesus is 0-6 lifetime against the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks, or that the worst draft slot historically is #11?); the ability to comment on individual news articles; a league constitution (thanks James); and more.<br>	<br>	One key addition to the franchise pages is the prestige rating&mdash;those little stars you see next to your name. Those are computed programmatically based on winning percentage, points scored, playoff appearances, and trophies. The trophies are weighted in accordance with the year they were won (the more recent you won the award, the more weight it carries for your prestige).<br>	<br>	It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before EA contacts us about licensing rights for <i>JADDL Football [insert year]</i>.<br>	<br>	But we&rsquo;re not finished. The home page needs something to go alongside the Twitter feed. So chime in: what do you want to see when you first log in? Boobs?
