	Lockouts, realignments, leftovers, oh my!<br>	<br>	If you&rsquo;re a fan of football at either the collegiate, professional, or fantastic levels, you&rsquo;ve doubtlessly been swept up in all the media coverage surrounding first the NFL lockout, followed by NCAA conference realignment talk. The JADDL has not been immune to these swirling reports during the offseason.<br>	<br>	However, league owners issued a joint statement this week aimed at dispelling any more rumors from circulating.<br>	<br>	&ldquo;The JADDL and its members remain firmly committed to one another and to the common goal of furthering the existence of the best gosh darn fantasy football league on the planet,&ldquo; the statement read. &ldquo;At this time, all 12 members are committed to remaining a part of the league, now and going forward.&rdquo;<br>	<br>	Rumors have crept up about size modification&mdash;no, not like Dick Enzyte&mdash;on both sides of the spectrum: expansion and contraction. Back in June, several reports spoke to the possible defection of The Flying Pigs. However, Jacob ended that talk when he re-established and re-branded his franchise from the ground up in Tulsa.<br>	<br>	On the flip side, many outlets began to speculate about the JADDL desiring expansion into new footprints, to increase its attractiveness to potential TV partners. One source even had the league reaching out to former member Nathan about reinstating his Deadly Mexican Assassins franchise, one which is still in debt to the league from four years ago. This report was quickly laughed out of the blogosphere, however.<div class='news-quote'>The JADDL and its members remain firmly committed to &hellip; furthering the existence of the best gosh darn fantasy football league on the planet.<div class='author'>from league statement</div></div><br>	<br>	The JADDL has not been without turnover in its history. The aforementioned Assassins were not invited to extend their participation following the 2007 season, along with the Upset Underdogs. Mr. Intensity departed as well on its own accord, and was replaced by The Fifth Reich, keeping the league membership at 12 instead of attempting to ramp back up to 14. The following year saw the departure of The Fifth Reich and subsequent arrival of the Millennium Falcons. 2011 will mark the third consecutive year in which the member franchises have remained unchanged, offering stability to the league rarely seen in the fantasy football world.<br>	<br>	Even with this obvious stability, the shaky landscape of the football universe as a whole prompted the league owners to profess unity explicitly and assure their fans that as long as the NFL continues to have football seasons, the JADDL will be right there to make it exponentially more watchable.
