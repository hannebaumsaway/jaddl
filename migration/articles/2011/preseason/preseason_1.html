	Man, I&rsquo;m getting really tired of writing this preseason article over and over again. Somebody <i>repeat</i> already, would you?<br>	<br>	That onus now falls to Nolan and In Pursuit of Perfection to provide the JADDL with its first repeat champion, and the prospects aren&rsquo;t promising. IPP has a sub-.500 lifetime record (24-27-1) and just one playoff appearance since the JADDL took over for the Ragin&rsquo; Black Squirrels Association in 2007. Last year had a magical ending for Michael Vick<i>-tory</i> and his merry band of misfits, but let&rsquo;s be honest: Vick isn&rsquo;t putting up 36 points a game like he did in the final seven weeks of 2010, a stretch in which IPP went 6-1 on its way to the Court-Ordered Limousine.<br>	<br>	Oh, and one other thing: even if Vick <i>does</i> put up Arena League numbers again, he&rsquo;ll be doing it in Lawrence as the #1 overall pick for The Football Jesus.<div class='news-quote'>[Playing for IPP] was a hell of a lot better than prison.<div class='author'>Michael Vick</div></div><br>	<br>	In his place back in Wichita steps Jay Cutler. I think that&rsquo;s about all that needs to be said about the QB spot for IPP in 2011 compared to last year.<br>	<br>	Moving on, RB could be a strong unit for Pursuit, headed by Jamaal Charles and Ryan Grant. Both players have explosive potential and experience under their belts. Of course, they&rsquo;re also both prone to injury&mdash;especially Grant&mdash;which would call up Joseph Addai and C.J. Spiller. In other words, it would turn the RB position from a strength into a clusterfuck quicker than you can say &ldquo;bold and daring.&rdquo;<br>	<br>	On the WR front, IPP will be rolling out with Mike Wallace and Calvin Johnson. Meh.<br>	<br>	Nolan could not be reached for comment, as he was still celebrating his unlikely title from a year ago.<br>	<br>	When asked about his experience with the franchise, Vick said it was &ldquo;a hell of a lot better than prison.&rdquo; Take that any way you like.<br>	<br>	Vick went on to say he appreciates Nolan giving him a second chance after he was so abruptly dropped from Alex&rsquo;s good graces, and that he&rsquo;s glad IPP moved on without him. He explained that he fully expects to be hurt by Week 5 this year as teams key on him after his uprising a year ago, and that he would rather inflict that personnel damage on another franchise.<br>	<br>	James could not be reached to address Vick&rsquo;s comment, which has sent Football Jesus fan message boards into a panicked frenzy.<br>	<br>	In any case, Pursuit comes into its 2011 campaign ranked 7th in league history in points scored, 7th in points per game, 8th in total wins, and 8th in all-time winning percentage. But none of that matters, because it comes into 2011 ranked #1 in the universe in JADDL championships won in 2010.
