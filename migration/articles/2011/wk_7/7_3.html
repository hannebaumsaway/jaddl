	You guys were sent out a questionnaire in the interests of letting your fellow owners peek into your soul a bit. This was Alex&rsquo;s idea, so blame him if you think it sucked. But it doesn&rsquo;t suck, naturally. It&rsquo;s pretty awesome, and only strengthens our league (take note, Big 12!). Since the West is currently kicking the shit out of the East in every measurable way, they would have gotten to go first; however, I&rsquo;m still waiting on answers from one owner whose name ironically starts with &ldquo;No.&rdquo; The answers are given in the order I received them. Enjoy the insight into the Far East&hellip;<br>	<br>	<span style="color:#7777aa"><div class="section-head">Who&rsquo;s your primary rival?</div></span><br>	<b>James:</b> Odouls I guess. We&rsquo;re so bad it&rsquo;s hard to be a rival with me. Odouls might be my Iowa State?<br>	<br>	<b>Ian:</b> Bad News Bensons.<br>	<br>	<b>Ryan:</b> The Mighty Boom.<br>	<br>	<b>Adam:</b> Not totally sure but it would be between the Red Hornets (due to giving me my only 2 losses in 2007), Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks (series record currently is tied and my loss in the 2008 Jared Bowl) and The Mighty Boom (Boom&rsquo;s win earlier this year gave him the series lead at 4-3 but we typically have good matchups).<br>	<br>	<b>Alex:</b> Nothing gets my blood pumping and my nerves churning like a meaningful matchup against Boom. You might think that I&rsquo;d be more amped to play the Falcons, but their unwillingness to even remotely pose a threat makes it a &ldquo;blah&rdquo; matchup.<br>	<br>	<b>Peter:</b> Beating the &rsquo;Shanks is always at the top of my priorities.<br>	<br>	<span style="color:#7777aa"><div class="section-head">Do you like divisions?</div></span><br>	All &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; votes except for Adam, who preferred the old format because he had more success back then.<br>	<br>	<span style="color:#7777aa"><div class="section-head">What&rsquo;s the meaning behind your franchise name?</div></span><br>	<b>James:</b> It&rsquo;s a play on Larry Bird&rsquo;s nickname, &ldquo;The Basketball Jesus.&rdquo; I changed to DC Football Obama in &rsquo;08 to fix my franchise&rsquo;s mojo and as a joke about all the &ldquo;YES WE CAN&rdquo; hoopla, and because of the pic of Obama smoking a cigarette.<br>	<br>	<b>Ian:</b> True Greatness.<br>	<br>	<b>Ryan:</b> Nickname given to me in Prague by Pete.<br>	<br>	<b>Adam:</b> Created from a Jared Allen quote on the HBO series <i>Hard Knocks.</i><br>	<br>	<b>Alex:</b> I wanted something catchy and something that would truly identify the franchise (vs. an unnamed player that I had a hetero fantasy man-crush on). About 18 months ago James lectured me on how you had to give your franchise a true identity, how an owner <i>owed</i> it to the franchise to provide them a strong local brand. That conversation really stuck with me and that is why I made the switch. I agree with James 100% too&hellip;every franchise should have our geographic location or namesake as part of it. Something to look at as we amend the JADDL constitution down the road.<br>	<br>	<b>Peter:</b> AT TIMES I GET EXCITED AND WILL TALK REALLY LOUD. BOOMING.<br>	<br>	<span style="color:#7777aa"><div class="section-head">Do you care more about your favorite NFL team or your JADDL team?</div></span><br>	<b>James:</b> I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m that gone yet, it&rsquo;s the Chiefs.<br>	<br>	<b>Ian:</b> Currently, JADDL team. Until Tim Tebow returns the Broncos to greatness.<br>	<br>	<b>Ryan:</b> JADDL team without quesiton.<br>	<br>	<b>Adam:</b> Tough question. I typically will root for players on my JADDL team to do well even if it means KC will lose, so I guess that answers the question.<br>	<br>	<b>Alex:</b> Until I take home that damn Limo once, JADDL all the way. Me rooting for the Chiefs has no impact on the bang up job Todd Haley is doing with the team, or Matt Cassel peeing down his leg during a big moment.<br>	<br>	<b>Peter:</b> My JADDL team, and it is not even really close.<br>	<br>	<span style="color:#7777aa"><div class="section-head">Do you use outside sources for start/sit, waiver wire, and/or trade ideas?</div></span><br>	<b>James:</b> Sometimes I read Matt Berry&rsquo;s weekly emailed article, sometimes. Sometimes I get an idea from Grantland.<br>	<br>	<b>Ian:</b> Usually just the ESPN info.<br>	<br>	<b>Ryan:</b> No, I rely on my god-given eye for talent to get such hidden gems as Knowshon Moreno.<br>	<br>	<b>Adam:</b> Not really. I do occassionally use other sources for draft research.<br>	<br>	<b>Alex:</b> Yes. Research is part of the process, but gut/live scouting plays a big part too. I like to think of myself as a blend between Billy Beane and Dayton Moore.<br>	<br>	<b>Peter:</b> Liberally.<br>	<br>	<span style="color:#7777aa"><div class="section-head">Your favorite moment as a fantasy football GM?</div></span><br>	<b>James:</b> The league was not as big a deal back then, and no one remembers this, but in 2006 I had the top pick and rode LT all the way to a championship game&hellip;loss.<br>	<br>	<b>Ian:</b> Making it to the playoffs last year.<br>	<br>	<b>Ryan:</b> I won both my titles as a 6-seed, but &rsquo;08 was especially sweet, sitting in P.F. Chang&rsquo;s watching DeAngelo Williams singlehandedly carry me from certain defeat to improbable victory over Odouls, trying not to yell and fist-pump in the restaurant.<br>	<br>	<b>Adam:</b> The 2007 JADDL season. 12-1 regular season record.<br>	<br>	<b>Alex:</b> Bradshaw hitting a late 4th quarter TD against the Boom this year was a good one. But obviously last year was the top. Taking down the East and then reaching the Jared Bowl are the tops.<br>	<br>	<b>Peter:</b> Honestly, winning the league is a fairly distant memor. Currently, I would have to go with picking Peyton Hillis off the waiver wire last year.<br>	<br>	<span style="color:#7777aa"><div class="section-head">Your worst moment as a GM?</div></span><br>	<b>James:</b> Every week of 2007, the last two weeks of this year when I lost to Odouls and the Monkeys, and the end of this year if I don&rsquo;t make the playoffs.<br>	<br>	<b>Ian:</b> Not beating the Bensons yet.<br>	<br>	<b>Ryan:</b> Breaking my unblemished playoff streak in &rsquo;09 after missing the postseason by a single game in the standings. Also: every fucking god-foresaken game so far this season.<br>	<br>	<b>Adam:</b> Jared Bowl in 2008, also known as the DeAngelo Williams Debacle.<br>	<br>	<b>Alex:</b> This past Monday Night, hands down. See comment about aborting Matt Moore and Brandon Marshall. I&rsquo;ve never experienced a brand of fantasy rage like it.<br>	<br>	<b>Peter:</b> Toss-up between learning that Peyton Hillis is white, or realizing that I had just drafted Randy Moss and Shonn Greene with my top two picks of the draft last year.<br>	<br>	<span style="color:#7777aa"><div class="section-head">What would your franchise&rsquo;s stadium be named?</div></span><br>	<b>James:</b> The Creche.<br>	<br>	<b>Ian:</b> Rebel Base.<br>	<br>	<b>Ryan:</b> Patrick McGoohan Memorial Stadium.<br>	<br>	<b>Adam:</b> Team Odouls Field at The Watering Hole Stadium.<br>	<br>	<b>Alex:</b> The Den.<br>	<br>	<b>Peter:</b> Don&rsquo;t know. Don&rsquo;t really care.<br>	<br>	<span style="color:#7777aa"><div class="section-head">Favorite Movie(s)?</div></span><br>	<b>James:</b> <i>T2</i>.

Kevin McHale is not walking through that door, and Robert Parish is not walking through that door. And if you expect them to walk through that door, they&rsquo;re going to be gray and old. What we are is young, exciting, hard-working, and we&rsquo;re going to improve. People don&rsquo;t realize that, and as soon as they realize those three guys are not coming through that door, the better this town will be for all of us because there are young guys in that (locker) room playing their asses off. I wish we had $90 million under the salary cap. I wish we could buy the world. We can&rsquo;t; the only thing we can do is work hard, and all the negativity that&rsquo;s in this town sucks. I&rsquo;ve been around when Jim Rice was booed. I&rsquo;ve been around when Yastrzemski was booed. And it stinks. It makes the greatest town, greatest city in the world, lousy. The only thing that will turn this around is being upbeat and positive like we are in that locker room&hellip; and if you think I&rsquo;m going to succumb to negativity, you&rsquo;re wrong. You&rsquo;ve got the wrong guy leading this team.&rdquo; &ndash;Rick Pitino in an angry press conference in Boston<br>		<br>	<b>Ryan:</b> I don&rsquo;t know, but it definitely <i>wouldn&rsquo;t</i> be the &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t take our freedom!&rdquo; one from that punk-ass William Wallace.<br>	<br>	<b>Adam:</b> &ldquo;We&rsquo;re at a point where I&rsquo;m getting the fuck outta here. I mean if you&rsquo;re not going to cover Greg Graham if you&rsquo;re just gonna let him drive by ya, if the rest of you are gonna let him catch the ball outside the 3 second line and drive all the way in here without one guy challengin him, then I&rsquo;m leavin and you guys will fuckin run till you can&rsquo;t eat supper. Now I&rsquo;m tired of this shit, I&rsquo;m sick and fuckin tired of a fucking 8-10 record, I&rsquo;m fuckin tired of losing to Purdue. I&rsquo;m not here to fuck around this week. Now you may be, but I&rsquo;m not. Now I&rsquo;m gonna fuckin guarantee ya that if we don&rsquo;t play it up there Monday night you&rsquo;re ain&rsquo;t gonna believe the next fuckin day. Now I am not here to get my ass beat on Monday and you better fuckin understand that right now. This is absolute fuckin bullshit. Now I&rsquo;ll fuckin run your ass right in the ground. I&rsquo;ll fuckin run you, you&rsquo;ll think last night was a fuckin picnic. I had to sit around for a fuckin year with an 8 and 10 record in this fuckin league. And I mean you will not put me in that fuckin position again, or you will goddamn pay for it like you can&rsquo;t fuckin believe. Now you better get your head outta your ass.&rdquo; &ndash;Bobby Knight at halftime against Purdue<br>	<br>	<b>Alex:</b> &ldquo;We want you to know how happy we are for you and how much we appreciate your efforts to get to San Antionio. Getting here was tough. The pressure we felt to get here wasn&rsquo;t deserved, but it was the pressure of Kansas being in three Elite Eights the last five years and not getting here. We felt that pressure last week, and still prevailed. This week there&rsquo;s absolutely no pressure. This is the week we have fun. My challenge to you tonight: you have as much fun playing as I have coaching. If you do that, we&rsquo;ll have a great time, I guarantee it. We&rsquo;re playing a very good team, a team of great history and tradition. But they&rsquo;re playing a very good team with great tradition and unbelievable history. You came to Kansas to play in this game. You can&rsquo;t hope that good things happen &mdash; you expect them to happen, and they will. It will be a long game and there will be anxious moments, but enjoy every second of it, because you deserve it. Like coach Lombardi said, the most competitive men love the most competitive games. This is one of those games, and we know how competitive you are. I expect to have a big celebration here in about 2&frac12; hours.&rdquo; &ndash;Bill Self before &rsquo;08 UNC game<br>	<br>	<b>Peter:</b> &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fuck this up, men.&rdquo; &ndash;Peter<br>	<br>	<span style="color:#7777aa"><div class="section-head">Boxers or briefs?</div></span><br>	Boxers: James<br>	Boxer-briefs: Ryan, Adam, Peter<br>	Both: Alex<br>	<br>	<span style="color:#7777aa"><div class="section-head">Favorite ice cream flavor?</div></span><br>	<b>James:</b> Neapolitan.<br>		<br>	<b>Ryan:</b> Chocolate chip cookie dough.<br>	<br>	<b>Adam:</b> Baskin Robbins&rsquo; pink bubble gum.<br>	<br>	<b>Alex:</b> Butter pecan.<br>	<br>	<b>Peter:</b> Cookies &rsquo;n&rsquo; cream.<br>	<br>	<span style="color:#7777aa"><div class="section-head">Ice cream or cake?</div></span><br>	Cake: James<br>	Ice cream: Ryan, Adam, Peter<br>	Ice-cream cake: Alex<br>	<br>	<span style="color:#7777aa"><div class="section-head">Cake or pie?</div></span><br>	Everyone chose pie.<br>	<br>	<span style="color:#7777aa"><div class="section-head">What type of pizza do you go for?</div></span><br>	<b>James:</b> Pepperoni with red onion.<br>		<br>	<b>Ryan:</b> Pepperoni and bacon.<br>	<br>	<b>Adam:</b> Lots of meats. New York Pizzeria Mulberry Special.<br>	<br>	<b>Alex:</b> Deep dish style first. Followed by anything w/ beef and lots of veggies if you&rsquo;re doing the standard.
