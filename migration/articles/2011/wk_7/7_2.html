	<div class="game-header">The IPA Connoisseur 92.1&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Bad News Bensons 103.5</div>	Hey Lannie: you&rsquo;re doing well this year, but putting so much faith in the Ravens&rsquo; offense isn&rsquo;t the best idea you&rsquo;ve ever had. As for Bad News: <i>Laissez les bons temps rouler!</i>

<br><br>	<div class="game-header">One Pump Chumps 102.2&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Millennium Falcons 91.2</div>	Solid game here. Don&rsquo;t look now, but the Chumps&mdash;yes, the same team which Jake Gutierrez handed out an &ldquo;F&rdquo; grade to&mdash;have won three straight. Cammy Cam is easily the waiver wire pickup of the season so far. On the Falcons&rsquo; side, you&rsquo;d think you&rsquo;d win when you get 33 points from DeMarco Murray, and you normally would&hellip;when you don&rsquo;t have Elizabeth Hasselbeck&rsquo;s no-talent assclown husband stinking up the QB slot.

<br><br>	<div class="game-header">Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks 87.0&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Tulsa Angry Monkeys 105.0</div>	Not to be outdone by the Chumps, the Monkeys have now won <i>four</i> in a row. Aaron Rodgers gives you a large margin of error at your other positions. Marshawn Lynch used up that entire margin by putting up a goose egg, but the Monkeys got 29 from their D/ST and kicker combined, enough to push them over the snakebitten &rsquo;Shanks.

<br><br>	<div class="game-header">The Lawrence Football Jesus 67.7&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;In Pursuit of Perfection 92.4</div>	Jesus got nearly 30 points from Big Ben and&hellip;no, wait, that&rsquo;s actually the end of the relevant scoring summary for Jesus. IPP got a win it desperately needed, carried by its stellar WR combo of Megatron and [insert Mike Wallace&rsquo;s <i>Transformers</i> nickname here].

<br><br>	<div class="game-header">Team Hauloll 55.7&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mighty Boom 32.2</div>	I&rsquo;m not going to dignify this fucking game with a write-up.
