	Dan was fed up. He had simply had enough. Six weeks of losing was more than he could bear. So in Week 7 he made sure his lineup was star-studded, too good to fail.<br>	<br>	Nate Washington.<br>	<br>	Mohamed Massaquoi.<br>	<br>	Dane Sanzenbacher.<br>	<br>	You can&rsquo;t walk five blocks in Phoenix without seeing a Red Hornets jersey with one of those names on the back. Household names up and down the roster, cocked, locked, and ready to rock. But at gametime, there was just one problem&hellip;<br>	<br>	They didn&rsquo;t rock.<br>	<div class='news-quote'>Um, yeah, it&rsquo;s good to get a win under our belts and&hellip;listen, can I call you back in a few hours? It&rsquo;s really early here.<div class='author'>Dan</div></div><br>	In fact, they sucked. Ass. None of them scored in double figures. None of them even eclipsed the five-point mark. Hell, not a single one of them even made it to <i>two</i>. There was no way the Hornets could survive such drastic duds from its scoring core, right?<br>	<br>	Wrong!<br>	<br>	Along comes an unsung hero, a guy no one has ever heard of. Somebody named &ldquo;Arian&rdquo; Foster. (No one knows his real first name.) Despite the slight misspelling, Foster is clearly a fan of Adolf Hitler&rsquo;s idea of a perfect race, which is ironic, considering how he has black&hellip;hair. But he was perfect on the football field Sunday, rushing for 115 yards and two touchdowns while also racking up 119 receiving yards and another score. All that added up to 43.4 fantasy points.<br>	<br>	That turned out to be more than enough, as the &rsquo;Nets stung Team Odouls 101.6&ndash;61.3 for their first win of the season, effectively putting an end to 0-and-13 Watch 2011.<br>	<br>	&ldquo;Eh? What time is it?&rdquo; Dan yawned on his cell phone. &ldquo;Um, yeah, it&rsquo;s good to get a win under our belts and&hellip;listen, can I call you back in a few hours? It&rsquo;s really early here.&rdquo;<br>	<br>	Sure you can, Dan; to the victor go the spoils. That hasn&rsquo;t applied to you in quite some time. It&rsquo;s doubtful the win will mean much in the grand scheme of things, however, as the West remains incredibly top-heavy with four teams locked at 5-2, all with winning divisional records as well. That top-heaviness only looks to get more pronounced as the West gets one more week to beat up on the hapless East in interdivisional play.<br>	<br>	One more good thing did come out of the weekend for the Hornets, though: not only did they avoid more humiliating weeks of 0-and-13 Watch; they climbed up off the bottom rung of the Power Rankings as well, moving ahead of the dying-and-not-rising Football Jesus in the points race.<br>	<br>	Should Jesus finish last in points after securing the number one overall pick, 2011 may be James&rsquo; most pathetic season yet. And that&rsquo;s saying something.
