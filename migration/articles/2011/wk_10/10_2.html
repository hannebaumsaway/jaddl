	<div class="game-header">One Pump Chumps 116.0&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;The IPA Connoisseur 75.1</div>	One of these teams had a tight end as its leading scorer. The other had its quarterback. &hellip;The one with the tight end won. IPA has a superb RB corps, but the rest of the team? Eh&hellip;

<br><br>	<div class="game-header">The Lawrence Football Jesus 61.6&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Millennium Falcons 113.5</div>	As the disciples might have said at The Last Supper, Jesus is in serious trouble. Michael &ldquo;Number One Overall&rdquo; Vick is underperforming and possibly hurt. The rest of the team isn&rsquo;t worth writing about at this point. Meanwhile, the Falcons are soaring, winners of three straight. DeMarco Murray: the best waiver wire pickup since&hellip;ahem&hellip;Michael Vick.

<br><br>	<div class="game-header">In Pursuit of Perfection 72.6&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Red Hornets 101.4</div>	Check out the Hornets&rsquo; impression of a non-crappy fantasy football team! Tony Romo is such a tease, isn&rsquo;t he Dan? Oh, and Arian Foster is purty good. IPP had just three players in double figures, and two of them were non-skill position slots.

<br><br>	<div class="game-header">Team Hauloll 57.5&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Tulsa Angry Monkeys 101.7</div>	Yes, yes, the Monkeys are on a nice run, and Aaron Rodgers is the shit. But what the hell is wrong with Hauloll? Losers of three in a row, they had <i>four players</i> score less than <i>two</i> points. Yikes.

<br><br>	<div class="game-header">Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks 82.2&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Team Odouls 76.7</div>	Surprise, surprise, the &rsquo;Shanks in a close game. Hilariously, they aren&rsquo;t out of the playoff race yet after two consecutive victories. That&rsquo;s how bad the East is, folks. Part of that crappy East is Team Odouls, losers of three of their last four now.
