	Ah, The Lawrence Football Jesus.<br>	<br>	Least prestigious of all active JADDL franchises on this terrestrial plane. The most skewed ratio of emotional investment and dedication to the sport to returns on that investment.<br>	<br>	Father of the divisional format. King of the Jews.<br>	<br>	The Jesus was granted a gift from heaven prior to the start of the 2011 season: the number one overall draft position. Jesus had never been in that illustrious spot prior to that point. The excitement in Lawrence over what that could mean to the franchise was nearly suffocating.<br>	<br>	The number one pick&hellip;dear God! The possibilities were endless! The sky was the limit!<br>	<br>	Jesus had made the playoffs a single time in the JADDL&rsquo;s previous four years. Even then, they snuck in <i>despite</i> a losing record (6-7) in the regular season. They failed to surpass four wins in their other three seasons, including the worst season to date in the league: a 1-9-3 campaign in 2007.<br>	<br>	This isn&rsquo;t the singing, dancing messiah from <i>Jesus Christ Superstar</i>. This is the beaten, bloodied, emotionally damaged Jesus from <i>The Passion of the Christ</i>. Who&rsquo;s sitting in the big leather chair at Jesus&rsquo; front office: James, or Mel Gibson?<br>	<br>	But no matter: this year was going to be different! The number one overall pick! No team in JADDL history has missed the postseason after picking number one. Jesus was going to the &rsquo;ship! You might as well put it in scripture.<br>	<br>	&hellip;<br>	<br>	&hellip;Alas&hellip;<br>	<br>	&hellip;Jesus might <i>not</i> be headed to the &rsquo;ship, as it turns out. The player Jesus picked first overall&mdash;Michael &ldquo;One&rdquo; Vick &ldquo;Pony&rdquo;&mdash;is barely scraping the top 10 among quarterback production in the league this year. Jesus&rsquo; RBs aren&rsquo;t good, unless they&rsquo;re standing next to their WR comrades, in which case the RBs look freaking god-like.<br>	<br>	This sketchy roster has Jesus on a disastrous heading toward the lowest scoring total&mdash;by <i>far</i>&mdash;of any team with the number one overall pick in JADDL history. Currently, Jesus is putting up 77.4 points per game. The next lowest total from a first-picker is 85.9, the clip Team Hauloll netted in &rsquo;08. In order to match that target, Jesus will have to average 114.3 points in its final three games.<br>	<br>	They have yet to score 114 or more this season.<br>	<br>	This is setting up to be a devastating blow to a franchise in desperate need of a positive development. Jesus fans&mdash;affectionately known as &ldquo;Christians&rdquo;&mdash;thought they had that with the draft at the beginning of the season. Instead, it&rsquo;s turning out to be a slap in the face&hellip;an insult heaped onto years of imaginary injury. Or, if we&rsquo;re sticking with the Jim Caviezel analogy, a horrifying knotted whip to the back several hundred times.<br>	<br>	No one wants to see this, just like no one was glad they saw <i>The Passion of the Christ</i> when it finally, mercifully ended. No one&hellip;least of all James and his Christians.<br>	<br>	But, as Actual Jesus taught his followers (I think), hope remains. Despite occupying the caboose of the points train, Football Jesus can still consider the playoffs an attainable goal. They share a 4-6 record with divisional rivals The Mighty Boom and Team Odouls. Get a win or two, get into the postseason, and miracles can happen.<br>	<br>	Or so the Christians have been conditioned to believe&hellip;
