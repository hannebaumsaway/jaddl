	Not many folks around the JADDL remember this, but The Mighty Boom missed the playoffs once. In fact, they sucked ass.<br>	<br>	Back in 2007, the league&rsquo;s first year as successor to the Ragin&rsquo; Black Squirrels Fantasy Football Association&mdash;&ldquo;RBSFFA&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t quite roll off the tongue like &ldquo;JADDL,&rdquo; does it?&mdash;Boom went 3-9-1 and finished in 11th place, scoring the fifth fewest points in league history.<br>	<br>	Since those dark days, as you know, it&rsquo;s been primarily sunshine and lollipops for Boom as they earned their Mighty moniker. In the past three years, they&rsquo;ve won no fewer than eight games in a season, posting top 10 historical scoring totals in two of those three years. Though they bowed out in the semifinals each season&mdash;something we can rightfully ridicule Peter for&mdash;they at least <i>made</i> the postseason each year, earning a bye twice.<br>	<br>	As 2011 came out of the starting blocks, it looked as though Boom would continue their winning ways in grand fashion. They scored 135.1 in a Week 1 win, securing their league-best 13th Briefly Badass award. Week 2 was much the same; Boom put up 128.4 in another victory.<br>	<br>	The Mighty looked mighty once again, leading the league in points after those first two weeks, leading non-Boom fans across the country to walk around with a <i>Not this shit again!</i> look on their faces.<br>	<br>	Week 3 produced another good score (101.5), but in a losing effort to the Bad News Bensons. That loss stripped the Boombadiers of their aura of invincibility, and&mdash;as so often happens&mdash;that sudden vulnerability seemed to overwhelm the franchise.<br>	<div class="news-quote">I haven't stressed the importance of getting a win here, because, frankly, my teams perform like poop when the pressure is on.<div class="author">Peter</div></div><br>	When Ivan Drago got cut in <i>Rocky IV</i>.<br>	<br>	When that scary god-king dude realized he could bleed in <i>300</i>.<br>	<br>	When a pitcher carries a no-hitter into the 7th only to get rocked for numerous runs once he finally gives up a hit.<br>	<br>	When perfection is clinged to and eventually slips away, what&rsquo;s left? The sense of doubt is palpable, and Boom did not escape. From Week 4 to Week 7, Tom Brady and LeSean McCoy were human, and the Boom front office went full retard on D/ST selections, getting negative outputs from that slot for three consecutive weeks&mdash;probably a JADDL first. The Mighty Boom crashed down with a mighty <i>THUD</i>, averaging just 64 points per game over that stretch&mdash;including a 32.2-point turd sandwich, the second lowest in JADDL history (Jesus scored 29 once in 2007&hellip;seriously).<br>	<br>	At the end of the double-black diamond ski run down the JADDL points standings, Boom found itself with a losing record for the first time since the end of 2007. But Boom has developed too much pride to go down like Lindsay Lohan&rsquo;s career (and appearance) since that dreadful JADDL debut. They breached the 100-point mark again in Week 8, but so did their opponent&mdash;by more. Another solid outing in Week 9 was ruined once again by another overperforming foe.<br>	<br>	They rose up and fought back, and all they had to show for it was two more losses and a 3-6 record. 2007, here we come! Right?<br>	<br>	Well, maybe not.<br>	<br>	This past weekend, Boom matched its Week 9 tally in a 93.7&ndash;55.8 drubbing of The Bad News Bensons, who are themselves on the verge of a similar fall from grace if things don&rsquo;t improve quickly. Wins don&rsquo;t come with any more value than this one; 4-6 keeps you in the thick of the playoff hunt in the putrid East, while 3-7 makes you the first team in 2011 to be facing the ass-end of the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks in the standings.<br>	<br>	&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t stressed the importance of getting a win here, because, frankly, my teams perform like poop when the pressure is on,&rdquo; said Peter, obviously referencing his 1-3 playoff record.<br>	<br>	Well, Pete: your Boom squad is one of three teams with 4-6 records, and there are three weeks to go&hellip;<br>	<br>	The pressure is <i>on</i>.
