	And people say they monkey around. Well, the Tulsa Angry Monkeys didn&rsquo;t monkey around this week. They put the freaking hammer down on the One Pump Chumps, 143.7&ndash;105.2.<br>	<br>	That 143.7 tally eclipses the Monkeys&rsquo; previous high mark of 135.2, set in Week 6 of 2009. It also was the high mark for the league this week, earning the Monkeys the Briefly Badass award, which doubles their all-time BB quantity to two (seriously).<br>	<br>	Tulsa was <i>not</i> led by Robert Meachem (5.9) or Mason Crosby (7.0). No; shockingly, they were led by Aaron &ldquo;My Name is So Much Easier to Spell than Favre&rdquo; Rodgers and his whopping 47.8 points. Rodgers became the first player in NFL history to pass for over 400 yards, throw four touchdown passes, and run in two more TDs in a single game&mdash;a simple, noteworthy record bound for NFL Films if I&rsquo;ve ever seen one&mdash;and the first player in <i>JADDL</i> history to do anything remotely newsworthy as a member of Jacob&rsquo;s franchise.<br>	<br>	Rodgers was Angry indeed.<br>	<br>	And he wasn&rsquo;t alone. The Ravens D/ST&mdash;led by the angriest person on earth, Ray Lewis&mdash;sliced up the Jets en route to 20 points of their own, while five other Monkeys also scored in double figures. Had Jacob played Frank Gore (19.9) in place of Meachem, it could have been a truly historic day: that would have put the Monkeys&rsquo; total at 157.7, which would have broken In Pursuit of Perfection&rsquo;s record for most points in a game, set a year ago.<br>	<br>	But Jacob will simply take the resounding win and be perfectly content with it.<br>	<br>	&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never even made the postseason&mdash;hey, stop laughing!&mdash;so scoring records are the furthest thing from my mind.&rdquo; Jacob thought for a moment, then added, &ldquo;Wait, have I ever even had an above-.500 season? No? That shit is bananas.&rdquo;<br>	<br>	B-A-N-A-N-A-S.<br>	<div class='news-quote'>Wait, have I ever even had an above-.500 season? No? That shit is bananas.<div class='author'>Jacob</div></div><br>	But the Monkeys would make the playoffs if the season ended today, sitting in third place in the West with a solid point total (4th in the <a href="news/2011/wk_4/index.php?view=standings&amp;which=power">Power Rankings</a>) and now a win over their fellow 2-2 Westerner, OPC. Rodgers doesn&rsquo;t look to be slowing down anytime soon&hellip;that Packers offense, it&rsquo;s so hot right now. A healthy Frank Gore should be a boon to Tulsa&rsquo;s sketchy RB corps, and Dez Bryant has the potential to be a fantasy star, provided Tony Romo remembers which team he&rsquo;s supposed to be throwing to at all times.<br>	<br>	As for the Chumps, 105.2 is a fine total, and the switch from Donovan McNabb (14.0) to Cammy Cam (32.3) proves Jesse isn&rsquo;t a complete moron. However, Jesse <i>was</i> <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/j_adams81/status/121044075767021568">tweeting about baseball during Monday Night Football</a>, so his intelligence is called back into question somewhat.<br>	<br>	So, in short, the race for the West is on, and the usually just-happy-to-be-here Monkeys are in the thick of it for once. Everyone loves rooting for the undermonkey.
