	<div class="game-header">Millennium Falcons 107.5&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Fightin' Longshanks 105.5</div>	Hey, look, another team scoring well above its average against the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks! Longshanks? More like Longshots, at this point. Points are well and good, but they don&rsquo;t get you into the postseason without wins. Try playing some DEFENSE, &rsquo;Shanks. Thanks to this effort, the Falcons have kept themselves in the hunt despite scoring under 80 twice already this season.<br>
<br>	<br>	<div class="game-header">The IPA Connoisseur 126.0&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;In Pursuit of Perfection 68.1</div>	Not a shining moment for the reigning champs. Getting 2.2 points from a healthy quarterback is hilarious, though I doubt Nolan found it very funny. Calvin &ldquo;I have a big&rdquo; Johnson and the Redskins D/ST were the only two double-digit scorers for IPP. IP<i>A</i>, on the other hand, vaulted to the top of the league power rankings with a solid effort led by a crushing 68.6-point output from its three-headed RB corps. That&rsquo;s right&hellip;IPA&rsquo;s RBs alone outscored Pursuit&rsquo;s entire squad.<br>
<br>	<br>	<div class="game-header">The Mighty Boom 75.7&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lawrence Football Jesus 108.3</div>	This East Game of the Week didn&rsquo;t quite live up to its billing. Like we all expected the minute the draft dust settled: as Michael Vick-in-a-box goes, so goes The Football Jesus. Vick went for 30, so The Jesus went for a victory. We can&rsquo;t really judge Boom until he gets Miles Austin and Aaron Hernandez (I mean it!) back in the starting lineup.
<br><br>	<br>	<div class="game-header">Team Hauloll 104.3&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Red Hornets 79.3</div>	DANGER, Dan Robinson, DANGER! When you average 77.8 PPG through four weeks, you start getting compared to the &rsquo;07/&rsquo;09/&rsquo;10 Football Jesuses, The Fifth Reich, and Mr. Intensity. Even when Tony Romo goes full Romo (courtesy of <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/sportspickle/status/120592052336599040">@sportspickle</a>), he&rsquo;s a better bet than Rex &ldquo;Eww That&rsquo;s&rdquo; Grossman. Adjust your lineup accordingly.
<br><br>	<br>	<div class="game-header">Bad News Bensons 83.5&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Team Odouls 70.5</div>	The bad news for Bad News: they had a pretty disappointing week. The good news for Bad News: they continue to be blessed with horrible outings from opponents, keeping their lossless streak alive. This is the second time already that the Bensons&rsquo; opponent has scored under 80, and he hasn&rsquo;t even played the Red Hornets! As for Odouls, QB Joe Flacco took a look at Jay Cutler&rsquo;s 2.2 points for IPP and said, &ldquo;I can top that!&rdquo; And he did, in a manner of speaking, submarining the Near Beers with a 2.1 tally.
