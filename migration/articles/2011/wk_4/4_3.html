	Much to the chagrin of my husband, The Lawrence Football Jesus, the JADDL fantasy football league has piqued my interest this year more than in seasons past (which is to say in seasons past, I have had zero interest).  I wish I could say it was because the JADDL has really stepped up its game through excessive tweeting and an Eastern Division trophy along with amazing fantasy football playing, but this is actually not the case.  Instead, I blame a combination of reading Grantland, Bill Simmons&rsquo; sports/pop culture mash-up website, and watching the FX show The League.
	<br>
	<br>The League might be my favorite show on television right now.  I like to pretend that I am Jenny, the super cool fantasy football wife that pseudo-manages her husband&rsquo;s team before being rewarded with a team of her own in the league.  But in all actuality, when The League devolves into actual talk of football, I get bored really fast.  Additionally, I have a pretty limited knowledge of the NFL, along with a belief that it is in every way inferior to college football.  In addition to pretending to be Jenny, fantasy football wife extraordinaire, I also like to pretend that I am a funny, smart, and witty writer ala Chuck Klosterman, who often writes for Grantland.  So, in an effort to make myself feel cooler, funnier, and more intellectual than I actually am, I pitched an idea for a guest column to the Commissioner, who, unsurprisingly, accepted.
	<br>
	<br>So, without further ado, I present the <b>NBC Thursday Night JADDL Awards</b>.  First, I need to apologize to the Westerners.  I don&rsquo;t know anything about your side of the league and I can&rsquo;t pretend like I do, so I am primarily focused on the East.  Additionally, there are only four show awards, so two teams from the Eastern Division won&rsquo;t get awards.  But don&rsquo;t feel too bad, no award is better than <b>The Whitney Award</b>.  In order of appearance on Thursday night:
	<br>

	&ldquo;<i>Community</i> is a great show!&rdquo; says Everyone.  &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait to get home and watch it!&rdquo; says No One.  Listen, <i>Community</i> really is a great show.  Unfortunately, it seems to inspire no one.  It gets perennially small audiences and always racks up zero Emmy nominations.  Yet, I can&rsquo;t help but think that <i>Community</i> is <i>this close</i> to being an amazing show; a show that everyone watches on Thursday nights, quotes on the weekends with their friends, and gets on the cover of Entertainment Weekly as &ldquo;The Best Show You&rsquo;re Not Watching.&rdquo;  But, alas, like The Boom, it just can&rsquo;t get there.
	<br>
	<br>The Mighty Boom may at first seem like an odd choice for the <b>Community Award</b>.  When you think of The Mighty Boom, the first words to NOT pop into your head are &ldquo;quirky&rdquo; and &ldquo;underrated&rdquo; or &ldquo;meta.&rdquo;  However, like the show, this season the Boom is <i>this close</i> to being an amazing team.  I can actually hear Boom&rsquo;s voice in my head saying, &ldquo;Listen, I really do have a great team.&rdquo;  But will he make it on to the cover of the newsletter with the headline &ldquo;The Best Team You&rsquo;re Not Watching?&rdquo;  Maybe.  Probably not, though.  
	<br>
	<br>Plus, both Tom Brady and Joel McHale seem to be really good looking men that inspire other men to feel love/hatred/jealousy at the same time. 
	<br>
	<div class='section-head'>The Parks and Recreation Award:  Bad News Bensons</div>
	<br><img alt="" class="cover" src="http://www.film.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Parks-and-Recreation-Season-1-2009.jpg" />
	I once spent an evening with LFJ and Bad News Bensons, wherein Bad News Bensons proceeded to quote <i>Parks and Recreation</i> to me for about 30 minutes straight, even after I told him that I do in fact watch the show.  While it may seem appropriate to give the <b>Parks and Recreation Award</b> to a man who has Ron Swanson&rsquo;s Pyramid of Greatness as his screensaver, it&rsquo;s definitely more than that.  Like the Bad News Bensons, you know what you&rsquo;ll get every week with <i>Parks and Recreation</i>:  a win.  Unfortunately for me, it&rsquo;s not much fun to write about a team playing well, so I&rsquo;ll just leave it with this:  the Bad News Bensons took a moderate placing in the draft and got players who turn in a solid gold performance every week and positive reviews from the critics.  It is the equivalent of watching Leslie Knope get drunk (amazing). 
	<br>
	<br>On a side note, can Parks and Recreation get rid of Ann Perkins?  I think we can all agree that she brings nothing to the show and that Rashida Jones should probably start looking for a new pilot to shop around NBC. 
	<br>
	<div class='section-head'>The Office Award:  Lawrence Football Jesus</div>
	<br><img alt="" class="cover" src="http://www.popdiced.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/james-spader-the-office.jpg" />
	I originally wanted to give the <b>Community Award</b> to LFJ, because it seems like drafting Michael Vick as your first-round pick when you have the first pick of the draft is a bit like flipping everyone off, which is pretty much what the <i>Community</i> script does every week.  However, after LFJ&rsquo;s win over The Boom this week, it&rsquo;s beginning to seem a little bit more like adding James Spader as Robert California to a dying <i>Office</i>.  
	<br>
	<br>If you&rsquo;re like me, you found yourself wishing last spring that NBC had the good sense to cancel <i>The Office</i> after Steve Carrel left.  It was dying and I didn&rsquo;t want to watch it suffer.  Like <i>The Office</i>, which has been the highest ranked show on the NBC Thursday night line-up, LFJ should have been golden with the first pick of the draft, but the beginning of the season left a little to be desired.  And I found myself thinking, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re going to make me watch it suffer.&rdquo;  But now <i>The Office</i> is back!  Well, maybe not back, but definitely not dying!  Last week&rsquo;s episode was solidly funny and I actually like the Nard Dog as manager.  Robert California is a much different dynamic than Michael Scott, but it seems fresh, not desperate.  Much like the LFJ&rsquo;s win over The Boom, <i>The Office</i> has bought itself a little more shelf life.  At least for this season.
	<br>
	<div class='section-head'>The Whitney Award:  Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks</div>
	<br><img alt="" class="cover" src="http://img.poptower.com/pic-53297/whitney-nbc-tv-show.jpg" />
	I don&rsquo;t know that much about <i>Whitney</i>.  I know it has a laugh track and Whitney Cummings (the title actress and creator of the show) seems unusually proud of that, which seems weird in this day and age of mockumentary style TV.  Usually when it is on, I&rsquo;m on the patio with LFJ and LFP (Lawrence Football Puppy) drinking a beer. But once the TV is on Thursday nights at 7:00, it doesn&rsquo;t get turned off until 10:00, so the only saving grace for <i>Whitney</i> seems to be the shows surrounding it.  
	<br>
	<br>But how far, exactly, does that grace extend?  A Longshanks win was dependent on how well the defense of his opponent played.  This is similar to <i>Whitney&rsquo;s</i> renewal projections being based on how many people don&rsquo;t turn off the TV after <i>The Office</i>.  This is a dangerous position to be in (see above:  <b>The Office Award</b>).  At this point things don&rsquo;t look good for <i>Whitney</i> and things don&rsquo;t look good for the &rsquo;Shanks either.  In fact, I think they will both fade from memory around the same time:  November, when <i>Whitney</i> is cancelled mid-season and The Fighting Longshanks don&rsquo;t make the playoffs.
	<br>
	<br>That is my extremely limited analysis of league play this week.  Here&rsquo;s hoping that <b>The Whitney Award</b> is soon replaced by <b>The 30 Rock Award</b>.  It will go to the team that plays hilariously and self-reflexively, but not at all memorably, and makes you think, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how this team is still around, but I&rsquo;m glad they are.&rdquo;
