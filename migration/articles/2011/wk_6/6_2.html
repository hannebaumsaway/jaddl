	<div class="game-header">Fightin' Longshanks 74.6&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;The IPA Connoisseur 126.4</div>	Sure, the &rsquo;Shanks played an opponent who exploded yet again, but that doesn&rsquo;t work as an excuse this time around. Their 74.6 output would have only beaten two teams this week. IPA made sure there was no doubt with this one, creating the fifth largest point differential of the season. This was over before it began.

<br><br>	<div class="game-header">One Pump Chumps 108.7&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mighty Boom 78.0</div>	Another blowout in favor of the West. The Chumps got remarkably balanced scoring across the board (minus Hines &ldquo;Ketchup&rdquo; Ward) to easily survive a less-than-spectacular outing from cammy Cam. Boom only got 25.2 from its WRs and RBs not named LeSean McCoy, and 4 of those points were taken right back off the board by the Vikings D/ST. By the way, that&rsquo;s the second consecutive week&mdash;and third time this season&mdash;in which Boom&rsquo;s D/ST has produced a negative tally. There is no future for Pete in D/ST consulting if he ever decides to sell the Boom franchise.

<br><br>	<div class="game-header">Team Odouls 98.8&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;In Pursuit of Perfection 78.7</div>	Odouls got 30.3 points from its TE, kicker, and D/ST. IPP got 32.7 from its QB and two RBs. That&rsquo;s all you need to know about how this game went down. Random observation: check out how many 11&rsquo;s were put up; 11.0 by Jahvid Best, 11.1 by Donald Brown and A.J. Green, 11.3 by Calvin Johnson. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbVKWCpNFhY">Spinal Tap would be so proud</a>&hellip;

<br><br>	<div class="game-header">Millennium Falcons 81.3&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Red Hornets 73.2</div>	81.3 is nothing to write home about, but if you&rsquo;re going to put that up, best to do it when you&rsquo;re playing the subject of an 0-and-13 Watch.

<br><br>	<div class="game-header">Tulsa Angry Monkeys 83.6&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lawrence Football Jesus 53.4</div>	Rut roh, Shaggy! The Ghost of Football Jesus seems to have caught up with the present iteration; 53.4 is what we would have expected from James in previous years, not the year in which he totes a #1 overall pick. That pick, by the way, was the only guy to score in double figures for the Gridiron Martyr. As for the Monkeys, they&rsquo;ll go as far as Aaron &ldquo;Brett Who?&rdquo; Rodgers takes them. So far, he&rsquo;s taken them to new heights; it&rsquo;s Week 7 and Jacob is still in the hunt. That <i>is</i> something to write home about.
