	There it is. Our first kick-in-the-nuts of the season.<br>	<br>	It happens every year. At some point, some team invariably loses in dramatic, fantastic fashion.
<br>
<br>	In 2009, the omnipresent techies at ESPN dropped the tough-guy movie line &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve just been <i>adjusted!</i>&rdquo; on James after tweaking the scores to snatch victory away from DC Football Obama on behalf of Team Odouls the morning after the MNF lights dimmed.
<br>
<br>	The next year, the fantasy gods&mdash;being just&mdash;evened the score in the James/Adam matchup by forcing overtime via instant replay in a meaningless NFL game, which allowed Football Jesus&rsquo; kicker to put a ball through the uprights and James through to the win column in the eleventh (twelfth?) hour.<br>	<br>	This year, fate has apparently decided to give James and Adam a break from the meddling.<br>	<br>	This year, fate aimed higher&hellip;right for the top of the East division, as a matter of fact. The first-place Bad News Bensons entered Monday night tapped out and holding a comfortable 16.6-point lead over perennial West powerhouse Team Hauloll. Hauloll had just one bullet left in the chamber: the Jets D/ST.<br>	<br>	Prior to MNF, the top five D/STs in the league had eclipsed 16.6 points six times this season. Six times in 28 opportunities. That&rsquo;s a 21% clip for those of you at home without a calculator. Of course, you&rsquo;re reading this right now, which means you&rsquo;re on your computer, which means you have a fucking calculator at your disposal.<br>	<div class='news-quote'>Seriously, I <span style="font-style:normal;">always</span> have good teams. Check out my franchise page on the league website.<div class='author'>Jason</div></div><br>	But I digress. Out of those six performances in question, one of them was by the Jets out of their five games to that point. One in five, or 20%.<br>	<br>	I assume you see where I&rsquo;m going with this by now, so I&rsquo;ll let the <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/JADDL_BadNews">@JADDL_BadNews</a> tweet progression tell the tale:<br>	<br>	9:30 PM: <i>Freaking Revis.</i><br>	<br>	9:43 PM: <i>white knuckle</i><br>	<br>	10:05 PM: <i>This game has meaningless pick at the end written all over it. That would equal a bad news loss.</i><br>	<br>	10:11 PM: <i>I think I&rsquo;m going to puke.</i><br>	<br>	10:13 PM: <i>And boom goes the dynamite</i><br>	<br>	10:19 PM: <i>I am beside myself with fantasy rage</i><br>	<br>	10:32 PM: <i>Matt Moore, you sir are a turd of a human being. Can&rsquo;t wait to get bye week destroyed by Lannie next week. We&rsquo;re in free fall.</i><br>	<br>	Yep&hellip;the Jets allowed just six points by the Suck-4-Luck frontrunner Dolphins&hellip;the same number of points the Jets D/ST amassed on turnovers alone. Add to that four sacks and a defensive touchdown, and Hauloll was looking at 21 points and an improbable victory. Alex was looking at his television screen despondently.<br>	<br>	&ldquo;Good teams find ways to win, and I always have good teams,&rdquo; said Jason. &ldquo;Seriously, I <i>always</i> have good teams. Check out my franchise page on the league website. Stats don&rsquo;t lie.&rdquo;<br>	<br>	We went to Alex&rsquo;s house for a comment, but he was still sitting in front of his television, which was still set to ESPN. We spoke to him and waved our hands in front of his face, but he didn&rsquo;t react or acknowledge our presence in any way&mdash;just kept staring vacantly in the general direction of the TV.<br>	<br>	So what does Hauloll&rsquo;s improbable 96.4&ndash;92.0 victory mean? It keeps them above the playoff guillotine in the West for the time being&mdash;the fourth-place Chumps are also 4-2 and just 5.2 points behind the Marysville monarch&mdash;and keeps the Bensons just a game ahead of the ravenous 3-3 four-pack in the East.<br>	<br>	By the way, losing a game in which Ahmad Bradshaw gives you 31 points is almost unfathomable. Turns out, Peyton Hillis (1.4) is just a white guy after all.
