	<i>You might not remember this, but in early 2011 the Big 12 actually had 12 teams! And in 2009, the JADDL had NO divisions! It was a crazy time, and in honor of things long past, I present to you the JADDL as if it were The Classic Big 12.</i><br><br><br><br><img alt="" class='cover' style='max-height:100px;max-width:100px;' src='news/2011/resources/images/logos/football-jesus-logo-10.png' /><img alt="" class='cover' style='max-height:100px;max-width:100px;' src='http://graphics.fansonly.com/schools/kan/graphics/kan-logo-licensing.gif' />The Lawrence Football Jesus is KU: It pains me to say this, but when it comes to consistently crappy football where greatness is only fleeting and the fans struggle to stay interested, the Big 12&rsquo;s got KU and the JADDL&rsquo;s got LFJ. Plus, both are in Larryville. Win or lose, we both still booze. <br><br><img alt="" class='cover' style='max-height:100px;max-width:100px;' src='news/2011/resources/images/logos/millennium-falcon.png' /><img alt="" class='cover' style='max-height:100px;max-width:100px;' src='http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f9/Iowa_State_Cyclones_logo.svg/737px-Iowa_State_Cyclones_logo.svg.png' />The Millennium Falcons are Iowa State: As in, they suck. The last time Iowa State had a winning season, Millennium Falcons owner Ian Wolfe was in grade school. The Falcons have never had a winning season. K-State and Iowa State have Farmageddon, the Falcons and the JADDL&rsquo;s K-State (Benson) have Brotherinlarmageddon. It works!<br><br><img alt="" class='cover' style='max-height:100px;max-width:100px;' src='news/2011/resources/images/logos/helmet-10-connoisseur.png' /><img alt="" class='cover' style='max-height:100px;max-width:100px;' src='http://autzenzoo.com/files/2011/05/colorado-buffaloes1.jpg' />IPA is Colorado: Do you remember the last time either of these teams were good? Neither do I. But Boulder has good beer, IPA&rsquo;s named after one and they&rsquo;re both in the West. You know what they don&rsquo;t have in common? IPA isn&rsquo;t celebrating the 10th anniversary of a League Championship for a League it doesn&rsquo;t currently belong to!!! What the fuck CU? And IPA probably isn&rsquo;t stoned right now.   <br><br><img alt="" class='cover' style='max-height:100px;max-width:100px;' src='news/2011/resources/images/logos/ipp-logo-09.png' /><img alt="" class='cover' style='max-height:100px;max-width:100px;' src='http://www.playmakeronline.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/texas_tech_logo.jpg' />IPP is Texas Tech: Originally, the Hornets were Texas Tech and Nomac was Nebraska, but then I remembered that Dan likes Nebraska and has red hair. Thus, the Perfection Pursuers became Texas Tech. So here goes: IPP had never made the playoffs until they won the championship last year, and no one ever gave a shit about Texas Tech football (outside of Lubbock) until they hired Mike Leech. Both Tech and Nomac had a good run, but now it&rsquo;s time for both to return to normal. <br><br><img alt="" class='cover' style='max-height:100px;max-width:100px;' src='news/2011/resources/images/logos/hornets-logo-09.png' /><img alt="" class='cover' style='max-height:100px;max-width:100px;' src='http://www.huskerspot.com/history/images/nebraska-herbie-husker.gif' />The Red Hornets are Nebraska: Big Red, meet Big Red. Both have great traditions, the Huskers have won a few championships just like the Mountain Time. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, it&rsquo;s not like Nebraska has lost all of it games this year, but how good are the Huskers in 2011? Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s impossible to tell, since they play in the &ldquo;B1G.&rdquo; <br><br><img alt="" class='cover' style='max-height:100px;max-width:100px;' src='news/2011/resources/images/logos/opc-logo-09.png' /><img alt="" class='cover' style='max-height:100px;max-width:100px;' src='http://www.active.com/images/upimages/Missouri%20Logo111111111111111111111111.JPG' />One Pump Chumps, sorry, you&rsquo;re Mizzou: Listen, no one in the league probably wants to be Missouri. But if anyone fits the mold, it&rsquo;s the Chumps. They&rsquo;re usually pretty good, but they&rsquo;ve never truly been great. (OPC&rsquo;s JADDL bio says they won a championship in 2003. Excuse me? I don&rsquo;t think there was a league in &rsquo;03). Also, both Mizzou and the Chumps have pretty crazy twitter feeds. You know what separates the Chumps from the Zou Crew? The Chumps aren&rsquo;t classless bottom feeders who would sell out 100 years of history for a few bucks. Fuck Mizzou.<br><br><img alt="" class='cover' style='max-height:100px;max-width:100px;' src='news/2011/resources/images/logos/odouls-logo-09.png' /><img alt="" class='cover' style='max-height:100px;max-width:100px;' src='http://www.tamug.edu/images/TAMUlogoMaroonBevel.jpg' />Odouls is A&M: Both are in Texas, both are usually pretty good, and neither have any titles to show for it. Both were probably really drunk on New Year&rsquo;s Eve in 2006. A&M and Odouls can both beat you, but they can&rsquo;t scare you.<br><br><img alt="" class='cover' style='max-height:100px;max-width:100px;' src='news/2011/resources/images/logos/bad_news_bensons-logo-10-notext.png' /><img alt="" class='cover' style='max-height:100px;max-width:100px;' src='http://www.k-state.edu/paintball/powercat.jpg' />The Bad News Bensons are K-State: Alex probably isn&rsquo;t going to be thrilled with this one, but both the &rsquo;Cats and the Bensons are currently on top of their respective leagues/divisions. Both have legendary coaches. Don&rsquo;t believe Benson is the White Wizard? Consider this: Despite neither team winning it all, both have considerably overachieved. Snyder&rsquo;s got a 66% winning percentage lifetime despite a history so futile it boggles the mind; Benson&rsquo;s got a 75% winning percentage lifetime despite never drafting above pick #4. And both hate Mizzou. By the way, if the JADDL is the Classic Big 12, then the East is the Classic Big 12 North. Who&rsquo;s gonna win it this year? I don&rsquo;t know, but that team will have its shot to take home the Limo, just like little K-State had the shot to gut-check OU and The Visor in 2003.   <br><br><img alt="" class='cover' style='max-height:100px;max-width:100px;' src='news/2011/resources/images/logos/angry-monkey.png' /><img alt="" class='cover' style='max-height:100px;max-width:100px;' src='http://www.teamline.cc/static/images/logos/baylor.gif' />The Tulsa Angry Monkeys are Baylor (if you condense Baylor&rsquo;s rise over the past three or so years into the Monkeys rise over the past three games): Both started off in their respective leagues as collective laughingstocks. Right now, things look pretty good for both the Bears and the Monkeys. RG3, shake hands with your counterpart, Mr. Aaron Rodgers.  <br><br><img alt="" class='cover' style='max-height:100px;max-width:100px;' src='news/2011/resources/images/logos/hauloll-logo.png' /><img alt="" class='cover' style='max-height:100px;max-width:100px;' src='http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/545074/oklahoma-state-logo.gif' />Hauloll is Ok-State: Except they aren&rsquo;t; they&rsquo;re better. Frankly the Big 12 doesn&rsquo;t exactly fit the JADDL like a glove. Hauloll is really like &rsquo;Bama, if the Tide had only been around for a few years. Alas, &rsquo;Bama&rsquo;s not in the Big 12, and OU and Texas were taken. Hauloll has one championship and four playoff appearances in the past four years. Ok-State has been hanging around the Top Ten the last four years. You don&rsquo;t want to play either on the road. They&rsquo;re both sort of located in the Southern part of their respective leagues.     <br><br><img alt="" class='cover' style='max-height:100px;max-width:100px;' src='http://i133.photobucket.com/albums/q45/kougar24/JADDL/shanks-logo-11-vec-1.png' /><img alt="" class='cover' style='max-height:100px;max-width:100px;' src='http://www.playmakeronline.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/longhorns-logo21.jpg' />The &rsquo;Shanks are Texas: Circa 2010 that is. The &rsquo;Shanks, as Mr. Hannebaum never tires of mentioning, have won two JADDL titles. Texas has had two trips to the College Football National Championship in the past six years, winning the big one in 2005. This being said, Texas looked pretty shitty a couple of years ago, and hasn&rsquo;t beaten K-State since I was in junior high. The &rsquo;Shanks look pretty shitty this year, and haven&rsquo;t made the playoffs since I was in college. Both the Longshanks and the Longhorns have history, but that&rsquo;s cold comfort for either this year.  <br><br><img alt="" class='cover' style='max-height:100px;max-width:100px;' src='news/2011/resources/images/logos/boom-logo-09.png' /><img alt="" class='cover' style='max-height:100px;max-width:100px;' src='http://www.ou.edu/cas/nas/images/new_ou_logo.gif' />Boom is OU: Like OU, The Mighty Boom is a consistently excellent JADDL franchise. Like OU, The Boom notably bombs out late in the season. Both OU and The Boom have one championship in the last ten years, but it&rsquo;s been a while since either has brought home the bacon. Another notable random JADDL/FBS comparison note: Boom owner Peter Anderson dresses like former Buckeyes coach Jim &ldquo;Sweater-Vest&rdquo; Tressel, not Sooner coach Bob &ldquo;the Visor&rdquo; Stoops. This is a good thing.
