	Three straight playoff appearances. Three straight semifinal exits.
	<br><br>
	But this past weekend, The Mighty Boom ensured it won&rsquo;t be <i>four</i> straight. A 119.4&ndash;102.3 victory over the East champion Bad News Bensons took care of that.
	<br><br>
	The Bensons got 36.8 points from Drew Brees, but he and the Falcons D/ST were the only two players to eclipse 15. 102.3 is a fine score, but it wasn&rsquo;t enough to derail the Boom train, which scored over 115 for the fourth consecutive week.
	<br><br>
	Tom Brady led the way once again for The Mighty with 27, followed closely LeSean McCoy (25.7) and Aaron Hernandez (20.5). Also&mdash;and this is a big damn deal for Boom&mdash;they got a positive contribution from their D/ST slot.
	<br><br>
	Peter <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/TheMightyBoom1/status/147718925260570624" target="_blank">expressed his feelings</a> about the D/ST role in fantasy football during the game via Twitter: &ldquo;Ugh. I freaking hate defenses.&rdquo;
	<br><br>
	You know who he <i>doesn&rsquo;t</i> hate? Gisele Bundchen&rsquo;s boy toy. The Patriots got their shit together, and Brady is Brady again all of a sudden. That, along with the continued dominance of LeSean McCoy, means the Boomers are bad motha fuckas once again.
	<br><br>
	The Mighty&rsquo;s conquest means the Bensons have been denied a return trip to the Jared Bowl. After holding off the Millennium Falcons to keep hold of the Eastern Goblet, Bad News couldn&rsquo;t keep the momentum going into the postseason.
	<br><br>
	Let&rsquo;s face it: a team starting John Kuhn at running back didn&rsquo;t deserve to make it.
	<br><br>
	&ldquo;It was a good run. I did it to myself. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/drewbrees" target="_blank">@drewbrees</a> deserved better,&rdquo; Alex <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/JADDL_BadNews/status/148810909094129665" target="_blank">tweeted</a> following the loss.
	<br><br>
	Now we find out who takes home the Court-Ordered Limousine. Will it be the Virtual Vermeil winner in the Chumps, or will it be the new hotness in the JADDL, Boom?
	<br><br>
	Tune in to find out. Jared Bowl V: same bat time, same bat channel.
