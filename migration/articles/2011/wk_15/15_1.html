	Generally, scoring the second fewest points of the season in the semifinals is a bad idea.<br><br>
	
	Then again, style points don&rsquo;t mean shit after the conclusion of the regular season, and the One Pump Chumps survived their lackluster outing and live to fight one more time&hellip;for the whole ball o&rsquo; wax.
	<br><br>
	The Chumps survived because their foe, the Tulsa Angry Monkeys, <i>also</i> put up their second lowest point total of the season, which happened to be about 10 points less than the Chumps&rsquo; own mark. The Monkeys have been going as Aaron Rodgers goes all year long, which was swimmingly for the most part. However, any time you lean so heavily on a single player, you leave yourself vulnerable to the valleys that tend to accompany the peaks, and Rodgers&rsquo; rather pedestrian 22.6 wasn&rsquo;t quite enough to overcome not getting more than 17 from any other player.
	<br><br>
	&ldquo;It would have been nice to win the whole fuckin&rsquo; thing on my first trip to the playoffs,&rdquo; said Jacob, &ldquo;but what chaps my ass the most is that it was my hometown Chiefs who took down my beloved Packers and, in the end, my Monkeys as well.&rdquo;
	<br><br>
	Discount Doublecheck&rsquo;s 22.6 was nearly negated by Cammy Cam Juice&rsquo;s 19.3 on the OPC side of the field, which freed up Reggie Bush of all people to carry the day, scoring an improbable 26.9 to secure the victory for the Chumps.
	<br><br>
	&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had this in me all along,&rdquo; said Bush following the game. &ldquo;All Jesse had to do was promise my mom a new house in Manhattan, and bam!&mdash;I&rsquo;m takin&rsquo; him to the &rsquo;ship.&rdquo;
	<br><br>
	This will be OPC&rsquo;s first trip to the Jared Bowl since its 2003 title run, long before it was even called the Jared Bowl&hellip;hell, before Jared Allen himself was even in the NFL (he was drafted in &rsquo;04). For a franchise that has actually seen quite a bit of success on the field with little hardware to show for it, a golden opportunity awaits the Chumps next weekend.
	<br><br>
	However, OPC isn&rsquo;t the only franchise looking to add tangible rewards to a long string of fruitful seasons. The Mighty Boom is hungry as well, and the battle between two pre-JADDL champs is set.
