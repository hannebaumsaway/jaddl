	<div class="game-header">Tulsa Angry Monkeys 86.2&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Team Hauloll 127.8</div>	4 points from your RB corps, Jacob? Yeesh. But don&rsquo;t fret&hellip;it&rsquo;s not like you were beating Hauloll anyway. Wes Welker, good lord&hellip;over 30 twice already this season. Is Welker the new Vick?<br>
<br>	<b>Reich&rsquo;s Pick: Hauloll (+4.8) <span style="color:#55aa55">/WIN</span></b><br>	<div class="pick-revisited">Nailed it.</div>
<br><br>	<div class="game-header">Red Hornets 70.4&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;In Pursuit of Perfection 127.6</div>	Alright, Stinging Ginger fans, it&rsquo;s officially time to start worrying. The &rsquo;Nets have gone down in production each of the first three weeks&hellip;and they only started at 83.9. A 77.3 average isn&rsquo;t going to get it done; that&rsquo;d be dead last among active franchises. IPP had a huge week when you consider the fact that his bench put up 64.7 of its own. Roster decisions become <i>real</i> easy when that happens.<br>
<br>	<b>Reich&rsquo;s Pick: IPP (+3.6) <span style="color:#55aa55">/WIN</span></b><br>	<div class="pick-revisited">Well, after an early scare, I see that not <i>all</i> is wrong in the universe.</div>
<br><br>	<div class="game-header">The IPA Connoisseur 78.6&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;One Pump Chumps 105.7</div>	Hey, the Chumps look pretty solid, considering they had what many JADDL experts&mdash;including Jake Gutierrez&mdash;considered to be one of the worst drafts of all time, not even counting the Peyton Manning debacle. I&rsquo;m sure Jesse will gladly take a 103.4 average at this point. As for The Connoisseur: c&rsquo;mon, we all knew they weren&rsquo;t going undefeated.
<br><br>	<b>Reich&rsquo;s Pick: Connoisseur (-20.0) <span style="color:#aa5555">/FAIL</span></b><br>	<div class="pick-revisited">The Terrible Three were terrible. Two points in a win, Michael Turner? Nine rushes for two yards, Matt Forte? (OK&hellip;he also had 80 yds. rushing.) But OPC makes TWO 20-point dogs to win outright. What a week.</div>
<br><br>	<div class="game-header">Team Odouls 106.8&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks 74.2</div>	Odouls is coming off its first losing season ever, and if it wanted to avoid consecutive ones, this was a must-win. Everyone laughed when Adam drafted Daniel Thomas so high, but the EMAW warrior is averaging 14 PPG thus far. As for the &rsquo;Shanks, they had three Chargers going up against the Chiefs, and the trio only scored 37.3. This was their shot to right the ship, and instead, they pointed their cannons at their own deck and fired away. Abandon ship!
<br><br>	<b>Reich&rsquo;s Pick: Odouls (+22.7) <span style="color:#55aa55">/WIN</span></b><br>	<div class="pick-revisited">I totally missed this one. Joe Flacco had 32 points, and the Near Beers had three more in double digits.</div>
<br><br>	<div class="game-header">Millennium Falcons 61.1&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lawrence Football Jesus 82.0</div>	Isaac Redman&hellip;Andre Caldwell&hellip;is Ian just fucking with us? When you play guys like that, you score in the 60s. And lose. The Falcons&rsquo; depth appears to be a real concern. 82.0 is a <i>meh</i> score, but James isn&rsquo;t one to scoff at being 2-1, however he gets there. Check out LT leading all scorers&hellip;is this 2007?
<br><br>	<b>Reich&rsquo;s Pick: Falcons (+10.0) <span style="color:#aa5555">/FAIL</span></b>
<br>	<div class="pick-revisited">Not much of an inspired win by the Jesus, but like they say, a win&rsquo;s a win. And 2-1 will get you into the playoffs. The Jesus stay in the front-running for the contested 3rd East playoff slot.</div>
