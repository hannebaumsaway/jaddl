	That&rsquo;s right, Bad News Bensons. You are the official flavor of the year as the last remaining unbeaten in the JADDL. You have the chance to do what no team has ever done before: go 13-0.<br>	<br>	&hellip;If your luck lasts, that is.<br>	<br>	What&rsquo;s that? Oh yeah: you have had the second fewest points scored <i>against</i> you in this young season. Sure, you&rsquo;ve also scored the third most, but consider this: you still have to go on the road to face the two teams above you in the <a href="news/2011/wk_3/index.php?view=standings&amp;which=power">Power Rankings</a>&mdash;Team Hauloll (Week 6) and The Mighty Boom (Week 10).<br>	<br>	With that being said, the Bensons <i>did</i> just dispose of Boom this past weekend. Of course, that was against a Boom team riddled with injuries, which put up its lowest output so far this season. TE Aaron Hernandez and WR Miles Austin didn&rsquo;t suit up for The Mighty, and they had combined for 77.6 points to date. A big void to fill, especially by the likes of Fred Davis and Mike Thomas. If you&rsquo;re asking who Mike Thomas is (and you probably are), he&rsquo;s a receiver for the Jags.<br>	<br>	&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to make excuses; we lost,&rdquo; Peter said following the game. &ldquo;The last thing I want to do is make excuses. But that was basically our J.V. squad out there. Which is no excuse, just a fact. Would we have won had we had all our usual starters active? I&rsquo;m not going to speculate on that. But&hellip;yes.&rdquo;<br>	<br>	A defensive Alex was quick to point out that the Bensons weren&rsquo;t a full strength either.<br>	<div class='news-quote'>You all love to suck Peter&rsquo;s peter, but the numbers don&rsquo;t lie. <span style="font-style:normal;">I&rsquo;m</span> the true class of the East.<div class='author'>Alex, Bensons owner</div></div><br>	&ldquo;Did you see Peyton [Hillis] in the game? Me either, because he and his 15.2 average were on the bench, bitches.&rdquo;<br>	<br>	It turns out Bad News didn&rsquo;t require Hillis&rsquo; services this weekend, taking down Boom&rsquo;s J.V. team 112.6&ndash;101.5 behind strong outings from Drew Brees and Ahmad Bradshaw.<br>	<br>	It needs to be noted that even against Boom&rsquo;s varsity squad, success is not an anomaly for the Bensons. In fact, they&rsquo;re the only team in the East with a winning record against the 5-star megadynasty (5-3). They&rsquo;ve also outscored The Mighty 796.6 to 721.6 head to head throughout JADDL play.<br>	<br>	&ldquo;You all love to suck Peter&rsquo;s peter, but the numbers don&rsquo;t lie,&rdquo; said Alex. &ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;m</i> the true class of the East; the real dynasty to the right of the chasm.&rdquo;<br>	<br>	When a reporter asked Alex if he truly believed the Bensons should be considered a dynasty without having won any championships, the Bensons&rsquo; public relations director quickly stepped in and put an end to the post-game conference.
