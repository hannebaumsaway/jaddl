	Pop quiz, hot shot: how many JADDL franchises have won more than one Court-Ordered Limousine?<br>	<br>	Answer: two. Follow-up: which franchises are they?<br>	<br>	Answer: the Red Hornets and Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks.<br>	<br>	&hellip;Yes, the same Red Hornets and Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks who missed the playoffs twice in the last three years. The same Red Hornets and Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks who failed to eclipse the 75-point mark this past weekend.<br>	<br>	The same Red Hornets and Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks who have started 2011 0-3, officially reviving the <i>O and 13 Watch</i> Lawrence Football Jesus kept alive until Week 9 two seasons ago.<br>	<br>	So what happened to these once proud franchises? Their unique duplication (oxymoron?) of championships has allowed them to retain Dynasty status (defined by a Prestige rating of 4+ stars), but that is in serious jeopardy after the thud 2011 started with for each franchise. Jake Gutierrez saw this coming for the &rsquo;Shanks when he reviewed the draft and awarded them a &ldquo;D&rdquo; grade. In the Hornets, however, Gutierrez saw potential, granting them a &ldquo;B-.&rdquo;<br>	<div class='news-quote'>You&rsquo;re beginning to see the effects of me being worn so thin by my double duties as owner and league commissioner.<div class='author'>Ryan, Longshanks owner</div></div><br>	Despite that decent grade, the &rsquo;Nets are currently at the bottom of the heap in terms of points scored. The &rsquo;Shanks aren&rsquo;t much better, sitting at 9th in the points race.<br>	<br>	What&rsquo;s more: the Hornets and Longshanks have had the most and second-most points scored <i>against</i> them, respectively, so far this year. So which way are we to interpret that stat: are these two dynasties doubly fucked, or is their abysmal start reflective in no small part to their bad scheduling luck?<br>	<br>	The &rsquo;Shanks can make a better case for the latter, seeing as how they put up 114 in a loss already. The Hornets have yet to break 85. But again, the &rsquo;Shanks are still right there with the &rsquo;Nets in the bottom third of the league points race, so it isn&rsquo;t as if their bad start is completely due to being snakebitten.<br>	<br>	Whatever the cause, these two fading dynasties are in serious danger of being overtaken by the seemingly hungrier Bad News Bensons (3-0) and defending champs In Pursuit of Perfection (2-1) in the Prestige pecking order by the time the curtain falls on the 2011 season.<br>	<br>	&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an unfair playing field since I have to wake up so much earlier, relative to the other owners, to make my roster moves,&rdquo; whined Dan, a.k.a. <i>Mountain Time</i>.<br>	<br>	Good point, MT. That Arizona locale really seems to hurt Jason and Team Hauloll as well&hellip;the Team Hauloll which is second only to The Mighty Boom in Prestige, second to no one in wins and points, and has never finished worse than 8-5 in any season.<br>	<br>	Ryan had a different excuse for the lapse in on-field success for his &rsquo;Shanks: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re beginning to see the effects of me being worn so thin by my double duties as owner and league commissioner. I wouldn&rsquo;t be opposed to a rule granting the commissioner an extra 10 points per game, to level the playing field.&rdquo;<br>	<br>	Sure. We&rsquo;ll give the 'Shanks an extra 10 points per game. Retroactively, that brings their record up to&hellip;0-3.<br>	<br>	In a year that&rsquo;s on pace to shatter league scoring records, two of its (soon-to-be-former?) dynasties are a couple missteps away from getting run the hell over.
