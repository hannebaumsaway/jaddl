	<i>Man, I&rsquo;m getting really tired of writing this preseason article over and over again. Somebody </i>repeat<i> already, would you?</i><br>	<br>	That was the opening of <a href="news/2011/wk_12/index.php?view=news&amp;yr=2011&amp;wk=preseason">this year&rsquo;s preseason article</a>.<br>	<br>	Something similar will open up next year&rsquo;s preseason article.<br>	<br>	Nolan will once again be in pursuit of answers this off-season after his franchise finishes stumbling to yet another losing season&hellip;his third in five years. The 2010 championship will look even more like an anomaly when this season is in the books next week. That is the only postseason In Pursuit of Perfection has participated in since the JADDL was formed.<br>	<br>	IPP was already out of it before this past weekend, so they were playing for pride. They acquitted themselves pretty well, too, but it wasn&rsquo;t enough against the buzzsaw that is the One Pump Chumps, which took home the 103.1&ndash;92.1 victory. A victory which snatched the West division crown from the numb fingers of The IPA Connoisseur.<br>	<br>	Pursuit has just never had it this year. They currently sit at 10th in the points race, and have only scored 100+ a single time, way back in Week 3. Since then, they&rsquo;ve scored under 80 six times in nine games.<br>	<br>	Everyone knew IPP was in trouble when its first round draft pick, Jamaal Charles, got taken out for the season by a first down marker. Nolan used his next three picks to build up a formidable wide receiver corps before going after another running back.<br>	<div class="news-quote">I spent the entire season looking for my next Mike Vick on the waiver wire, and I never found him.<div class="author">Nolan</div></div><br>	That pick was spent on bust Ryan Grant, the 59th rated RB in the league.<br>	<br>	What that equates to is a pathetic stable of backs.<br>	<br>	And what a pathetic stable of backs equates to is a 3-8-1 record. Against OPC this past weekend, Pursuit started C.J. Spiller and Brandon Jacobs. That&rsquo;s really all you need to know.<br>	<br>	&ldquo;Who cares about the draft?&rdquo; said Nolan after the game. &ldquo;I spent the entire season looking for my next Mike Vick on the waiver wire, and I never found him.&rdquo;<br>	<br>	This year&rsquo;s Waiver Vick-<i>tory</i> did exist, but he&mdash;Cammy Cam, that is&mdash;was snatched up by the proud new owner of Jared&rsquo;s Goblet, OPC.<br>	<br>	All that&rsquo;s left for Nolan is a few more weeks to walk the streets of Wichita, half-heartedly whimpering &ldquo;The champ is here&hellip;!&rdquo;<br>	<br>	And in a few weeks, perhaps Wichitans will reply, &ldquo;Lannie is here? Where?&rdquo;
