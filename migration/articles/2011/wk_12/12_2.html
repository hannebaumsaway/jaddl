	<div class="game-header">Millennium Falcons 101.2&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bad News Bensons 127.8</div>	It would be too much trouble to look up, but I&rsquo;m going to go ahead and assume this was the greatest Monday Night Football performance by any single JADDL team in history. The Bensons had just 25.1 points after Sunday&rsquo;s games. On MNF, Mark Ingram gave them 15.4 more, and he was their <i>worst</i> MNF performer. Jimmy Graham added 20.4, Victor Cruz pitched in 29.7, and Drew Brees iced the cupcake with 37.2. All told, the Bensons responded in a huge fucking way with their backs against the wall to claim their second consecutive Eastern Goblet. Ian and his Falcons, meanwhile, are left banging their heads against the wall like the fat kid in <i>Mallrats</i> who couldn&rsquo;t see the sailboat, whimpering, &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t I beat the Bensons&hellip;what&rsquo;s <i>wrong</i> with me?&rdquo;

<br><br>	<div class="game-header">The Lawrence Football Jesus 109.4&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks 109.3</div>	Heh. With one meaningless NFL play, James was led to cry out triumphantly, &ldquo;Football Jesus!&rdquo; while Ryan simultaneously moaned despondantly, &ldquo;Jesus Chriiiiist&hellip;&rdquo; That play was a Brandon Jacobs run to end the Monday Night Football game after an Eli Manning screen pass brought the &rsquo;Shanks to within a tenth of a point of The Jesus. Because of the ensuing Jacobs run, that sliver of a gap survived, and so does The Jesus, while the Longshanks are now eliminated for the third straight year. The story will be the unbelievable crowning jewel to a series of fascinating losses that defined the Longshanks&rsquo; season, of course, but what <i>should</i> be talked about is how Football Jesus answered the bell when it needed to most, scoring in the 100s for the first time since Week 4 (when every fraction of a point was needed, in the end) to keep its playoff hopes alive. If they beat the Bensons next week, or if Boom loses to the &rsquo;Shanks, Jesus will rise&hellip;to the postseason.

<br><br>	<div class="game-header">The Mighty Boom 118.3&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Team Odouls 72.3</div>	You knew Boom wasn&rsquo;t going quietly into the night. Though they don&rsquo;t control their own destiny, they may in a way still have the inside track to the playoffs after this resounding (and expected) win over the now-eliminated Odouls. Boom, with #TheCurse on its side, will be favored over the Longshanks, while the East champion Bensons will be favored over Football Jesus. Should those two games go as most expect&mdash;a Boom win and Jesus loss&mdash;Boom would displace Jesus in the eleventh hour as the third and final playoff participant in the East, due to holding the divisional record tiebreaker.

<br><br>	<div class="game-header">Tulsa Angry Monkeys 101.3&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Red Hornets 88.3</div>	Though the spot was essentially locked up a week ago, the Monkeys <i>officially</i> clinched their first ever playoff berth with a fourth consecutive triple figure performance. There is still much for the Monkeys to play for next week, though&hellip;like Jared&rsquo;s Goblet and 90 bucks. Should the Monkeys beat IPA while the Chumps lose to the Hornets and score 36.9 points less than the Monkeys in the process, the Monkeys would come out of nowhere to snatch the West division crown. Unthinkable, but definitely not impossible by any stretch. OPC better take care of business next week and not relax due to erroneous tweets from the Commish.

<br><br>	<div class="game-header">Team Hauloll 107.7&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;The IPA Connoisseur 62.5</div>	Hauloll is out of the playoff race for the first time in JADDL history. There&rsquo;s nothing they can do about that now. But a franchise with as many wins as Hauloll doesn&rsquo;t simply flip a switch and accept losing. Jason&rsquo;s dynasty did switch over to the spoiler role, however, robbing Lannie of any shot at Jared&rsquo;s Goblet.
