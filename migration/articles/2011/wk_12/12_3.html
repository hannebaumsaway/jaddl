	The 2011 playoff puzzle is nearly complete; only one piece remains askew.<br>	<br>	In the Monday Night melee, the Bad News Bensons snagged the Eastern Goblet and a first round bye, while the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks were finally put out of their misery.<br>	<br>	In the West, the One Pump Chumps swept&mdash;literally&mdash;The IPA Connoisseur off its pedestal and completely out of the race for Jared&rsquo;s Goblet. That prestigious cup is now between the Chumps and the upstart Angry Monkeys of Tulsa.<br>	<br>	That means that the playoff picture on the left side of the bracket is complete&hellip;all that remains to be determined is seeding between the Chumps, Monkeys, and Connoisseur.<br>	<br>	The picture in the East still has a hole in it. The Bensons can rest easy, assured of a bye during which Alex can use part of his $90 award to buy the commissioner something cold, frothy, and alcoholic. The Millennium Falcons will have to shake off the disappointment of missing out on the division title quickly, as they will be playing in Round 1 of the playoffs in a couple weeks.<br>	<br>	<i>Who</i> the Falcons will be playing is still in question.<br>	<br>	The spot will go to either The Lawrence Football Jesus or The Mighty Boom. Perennial loser versus perennial powerhouse. Will this story end like <i>Friday Night Lights</i> (the movie, not the stupid TV show), with the underdog falling juuuust short? Or will it end like <i>Hoosiers</i>&hellip;does James have a Jimmy Chitwood on the roster somewhere?<br>	<br>	Should Boom lose to the &rsquo;Shanks this weekend, what Jesus does is irrelevant&mdash;Jesus moves on. If Boom wins, however, Jesus must defeat the division champ in order to stave off The Mighty and secure a postseason bid.<br>	<br>	When James was asked if he felt any pressure going into the final game of the regular season, he replied, &ldquo;Not even a little. This is what it&rsquo;s fucking all about, man. You put guys like Sebastian Janikowski on your team for moments like this.&rdquo;<br>	<br>	Peter was asked the same question, but hollared over it, &ldquo;<i>La la la! I can&rsquo;t hear yooouuuu!!!</i>&rdquo;<br>

They want to snatch up Jared&rsquo;s Goblet along the way.<br>	<br>	&ldquo;Wait, what? I&rsquo;m still in the hunt for first place in the division?&rdquo; said Jacob.<br>	<br>	Kind of. The Monkeys need to win, need the Chumps to lose, and need to outscore the Chumps in the process by 36.9 points. If one or more of these things fail to happen, Jesse will get the bye to ease his effort to make 2011 the new 2003.<br>	<br>	&ldquo;I can barely remember where I was or what I was doing in 2003,&rdquo; confessed Jesse. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve infused my franchise with Cammy Cam juice and we&rsquo;re going to the &rsquo;ship! The title game isn&rsquo;t during baseball&rsquo;s winter meetings, is it?&rdquo;<br>	<br>	Has there ever been a more exciting, meaningful Week 13? Doubtful. Don&rsquo;t turn that dial, folks. We&rsquo;re in for one wild ride. Well, except for Hauloll, the Hornets, IPP, Odouls, or the &rsquo;Shanks, that is.
