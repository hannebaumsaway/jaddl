	<div class="game-header">Tulsa Angry Monkeys 103.6&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;One Pump Chumps 118.7</div>	This is what JADDL football is all about. Two good teams, fighting to overtake the top of their division, putting their best feet forward when it matters most. The Chumps are the best team no one is talking about. They&rsquo;ve only lost once in their last seven games, and have eclipsed the century mark a league-best eight times. The Monkeys have done so seven times themselves, and this was only their second loss in their last eight outings. Cammy Cam kept pace with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9Rv7czl9cU">Discount Doublecheck Rodgers</a> and the Chumps&rsquo; supporting cast shined. Two heavyweights throwing haymakers&hellip;what a beautiful thing.

<br><br>	<div class="game-header">In Pursuit of Perfection 73.0&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;The IPA Connoisseur 119.0</div>	With the love-fest going on for the Chumps and Monkeys above, The Connoisseur would like to remind you that both those teams are looking <i>up</i> at IPA in the West standings still. &ldquo;Jordy & Ray&rdquo; may sound like a cheesy 80s buddy cop flick, but it&rsquo;s actually a one-two punch for The Connoisseur that produced half a hundred points. In other news, the beat goes on for the JADDL&hellip;this loss mathematically eliminates the defending champs from the playoff race. Another year will go by without a repeat champion.

<br><br>	<div class="game-header">Red Hornets 103.4&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Team Hauloll 64.5</div>	Remember when the Hornets were the subject of an 0-and-13 Watch? Now they&rsquo;ve won four of their last five. It won&rsquo;t do them any good, as they were already eliminated from the playoff hunt, but it&rsquo;s a nice way to end the season regardless. Hauloll isn&rsquo;t technically eliminated quite yet, but damn, they&rsquo;ve lost four straight&hellip;what the hell happened to them? The autopsy will undoubtedly have something to say about the Chris Johnson faceplant as the ultimate dagger.

<br><br>	<div class="game-header">Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks 80.9&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Millennium Falcons 81.4</div>	Speaking of beats going on, look! Another gut-wrenching &rsquo;Shanks defeat in which victory was fumbled (quite literally) away in the waning moments of the game. Only a true masochist could enjoy following the Longshanks&rsquo; season at this point. This was a game the Falcons needed, too, to stay in the driver&rsquo;s seat in the East. How far can waiver wire warrior DeMarco Murray take them?

<br><br>	<div class="game-header">The Lawrence Football Jesus 69.3&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mighty Boom 64.5</div>	There isn&rsquo;t really a stat for this, but in terms of crappy game participation, Boom has to be leading the league. In a year seemingly determined to take down the traditional powers of the JADDL, The Mighty have not been spared. Jesus held on for dear life on Monday night to remain squarely in the wild race for third place in the East.
