	With Thanksgiving coming up, the JADDL decided to get into <a target="_blank" href="http://www.babelgum.com/4012129/kids-reenact-the-first-thanksgiving.html">the spirit of things</a>&mdash;and make moms everywhere proud&mdash;by encouraging the owners to share what they&rsquo;re thankful for this season.<br>	<br>	&hellip;Then the commissioner forgot to send out the request to the owners for this bit of information, so instead we&rsquo;re going to infer what everyone is thankful for. Enjoy.<br>	<br>	<b>Lannie:</b>  I am thankful that, despite conjecture otherwise, fantasy football remains a runningback-centric league. I am also thankful for Twitter, as it gives me a great place to unload all the shit-talking I&rsquo;ve been holding on to for four years as my franchise sucked ass.<br>	<br>	<b>Ian:</b>  TEEEEEEEEEEEBOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWW!<br>	<br>	<b>Jesse:</b>  I&rsquo;m thankful (still) for 2003!!! Also for that pathetic Week 1 score, allowing me to get Cammy Cam off waivers!<br>	<br>	<b>Alex:</b>  I&rsquo;m thankful for trades, and for owners who are willing to do them&mdash;unlike some of you <i>losers!</i> Oh, and I&rsquo;m also secretly thankful for the least amount of Points Against in the league&hellip;<br>	<br>	<b>Jacob:</b>  I&rsquo;m <i>going</i> to be thankful for finally making the fucking playoffs. It should be fun to see what that right-hand column in my franchise bio is for.<br>	<br>	<b>James:</b>  I wish I were thankful for #1 picks. Instead, I&rsquo;m thankful I used my considerable powers of persuasion to get divisions formed a year ago&hellip;and that I&rsquo;m in the weak one.<br>	<br>	<b>Jason:</b>  &hellip;Wes Welker? Not much. Hey, Jacob: how did you spend your time each year while the playoffs were going on?<br>	<br>	<b>Peter:</b>  I am thankful for the opportunity to argue for the diminished significance of D/STs during the coming off-season.<br>	<br>	<b>Dan:</b>  Arian Foster and the demise of Daylight Savings Time!<br>	<br>	<b>Adam:</b>  Hmm. I guess I&rsquo;m thankful for the Packers D/ST&hellip;my only player in the top ten in its respective position ranking. Oh, wait! Owen Daniels is hanging in there at #10 among tight ends! I&rsquo;m also thankful for Owen Daniels then.<br>	<br>	<b>Nolan:</b>  I am thankful that I still get to yell &ldquo;The Champ is here!&rdquo; when I walk into a room&mdash;for five more weeks.<br>	<br>	<b>Ryan:</b>  Fuck this, I&rsquo;m not thanking this god-foresaken year.
