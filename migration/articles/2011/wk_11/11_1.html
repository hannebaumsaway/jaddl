	The race for the JADDL East&rsquo;s third playoff spot is <a href="news/2011/wk_11/index.php?view=news&amp;yr=2011&amp;wk=11&amp;pg=3">wide open</a>.<br>	<br>	It looks like Team Odouls wants no part of it.<br>	<br>	Losers of four of their last five, Odouls is tumbling down the side of the mountain at the time every general manager hopes his team peaks. Decimated by injuries and unexpectedly poor play from key components, Odouls is about as attractive to bookies in Vegas as O&rsquo;doul&rsquo;s is to alcoholics.<br>	<br>	Adam would channel his inner Han Solo and say, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my fault!&rdquo; He&rsquo;d be right, to an extent.<br>	<div class="news-quote">Stop with these accusatory questions! Didn&rsquo;t the commissioner explain my injury situation to you guys?<div class="author">Adam</div></div><br>	Three weeks into the season, despite a 1-2 start, Odouls averaged 98 points a game. More painful than the two losses to that point, however, was the loss of Andre Johnson. Odouls&rsquo; average dropped to 90 PPG over its next three contests.<br>	<br>	They did manage to even their record to 3-3 over that stretch, however, before the injury bug would take another nasty-ass bite out of them. Down went Jahvid Best in Week 6, and down went Odouls&rsquo; production into the shitter.<br>	<br>	Over its last five games, Odouls has put up just <i>64 points per game</i>, dragged down further in a 68.7&ndash;57.2 loss to The Bad News Bensons this past weekend. That&rsquo;s right: with everything possible on the line and there for the taking, the Near Beers failed to win a game in which its opponent scored 68.7 points. Just brutal.<br>	<br>	&ldquo;Stop with these accusatory questions! Didn&rsquo;t the commissioner explain my injury situation to you guys?&rdquo; Adam complained.<br>	<br>	What he failed to mention was that the Bensons have been just as devastated by injury as Odouls&hellip;perhaps moreso. They sent out Alex Smith, Danny Woodhead, and D.J. Ware, and won anyway.<br>	<br>	Still, there is only so much managing an owner/GM can do this deep into the season. Aside from hiring Ian as a waiver wire consultant, Odouls&rsquo; downward spiral may be unavoidable. For instance, Odouls is carrying three quarterbacks at the moment, but all three scored within 0.3 points of each other. With Rashard Mendenhall on a bye at the worst possible time, the rest of Odouls&rsquo; non-QB bench players combined for just 1.1 points.<br>	<br>	In other words, Adam suited up his best possible lineup, and still lost by double figures to a team that scored 68.7.<br>	<br>	Like I said: brutal.
