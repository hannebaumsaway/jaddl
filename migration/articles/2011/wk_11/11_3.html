	Two weeks remain in the 2011 regular season, and two spots remain open for the 2011 JADDL playoffs; one in each division.<br>	<br>	That means four teams have already clinched dance tickets. Fans of <b>The IPA Connoisseur</b>, <b>One Pump Chumps</b>, <b>Millennium Falcons</b>, and <b>Bad News Bensons</b> can go ahead and make travel arrangements while dreaming of the Court-Ordered Limousine.<br>	<br>	This will just be IPA&rsquo;s second-ever trip to the postseason. For the Chumps, this keeps 2008 as the only playoff-less blemish on their record. In the East, the Falcons will cement themselves as the most successful expansion franchise in JADDL history with their second straight playoff appearance. The Bensons will be looking to avenge their Jared Bowl loss from a year ago.<br>	<br>	The division titles and one-seeds are still up for grabs in both divisions. In the West, IPA is in the driver&rsquo;s seat as it has been all season long, though that seat is getting warmer by the week. The Chumps have caught The Connoisseur in records (both overall and divisional) but trail in points still by 46. The <b>Angry Monkeys</b> can still take home the Goblet as well, just a game back currently of the lead&mdash;though they are behind significantly in points (81).<br>	<br>	The Monkeys can&rsquo;t worry about the top spot just yet, however, as they still have to concentrate on making the postseason period. Perennial power <b>Team Hauloll</b>, despite a recent collapse, is still in the hunt for that third spot, technically.<br><br>	Technically&hellip;but not realistically. Though Hauloll trails the Monkeys by a surmountable two-game margin, they split head-to-head and are behind in points by an <i>insurmountable</i> 152 points. It looks for all the world like Jason is going to miss the playoffs for the first time in his franchise&rsquo;s history. All good things must come to an end, J-dawg. And with that end comes the beginning for someone else: this will be the first-ever playoff appearance (I know&hellip;laugh-out-loud) for Jacob. It&rsquo;s about fucking time, Other J-dawg.<br>	<br>	The picture is far more fuzzy in the East.<br>	<br>	The chase for the Eastern Goblet is down to the Falcons and Bensons, as they are tied atop the division with a two-game cushion over <b>The Lawrence Football Jesus</b> and play each other this coming weekend.<br>	<br>	The third and final spot in the East is open to all, as no team on that side of the chasm has been mathematically eliminated yet.<br>	<br>	Jesus has the inside track with a one-game lead on the bottom half of the division, technically, but they come limping down the home stretch having scored above 70 just a single time in their last seven games.<br>	<br>	<b>The Mighty Boom</b> may have the <i>practical</i> inside track when you get down to the potential scenarios with the final six games on the East&rsquo;s docket. They&rsquo;ve scored over 90 three times in their last four, and have the bottom of the division to close out their schedule. Boom also has both tiebreakers (divisional record and points) over Jesus, should it come down to that.
<br>
<br>	<span style="font-style:italic;">[Editor&rsquo;s Note: As our resident fact-checker James pointed out, head-to-head is actually used prior to points in a tiebreaker scenario; and Jesus did indeed sweep Boom. However, the only way Jesus and Boom can tie is at 6-7, in which case Boom would have a 6-4 divisional record while Jesus would have a 5-5 divisional record. Thus, Boom STILL has the tiebreaker over Jesus. Suck it, resident fact-checker.]</span><br>	<br>	<b>Team Odouls</b> is tied with Boom in overall records, but&mdash;like Jesus&mdash;would fall under both tiebreaker situations. Also like Jesus, <a href="news/2011/wk_11/index.php?view=news&amp;yr=2011&amp;wk=11&amp;pg=1">Odouls isn&rsquo;t exactly peaking at the right time</a>.<br>	<br>	Hilariously, the <b>Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks</b>, despite being part of 0-and-13 Watch for awhile and under some sort of voodoo hex, remain in the thick of the hunt. The &rsquo;Shanks lead the four unclinched contenders in points and have produced fairly steadily all season. And, thanks to their incomprehensible tie back in Week 8, they would avoid tiebreaker scenarios altogether. But, there&rsquo;s still that voodoo hex which clearly overrules any sort of logic or reasoning.<br>	<br>	Here is the long and veiny of it: Jesus controls its own destiny. Should James win out, he&rsquo;s in. However, it&rsquo;s no easy task: he has to go through the Longshanks (whom he is 1-6 against lifetime) and the Bensons, who are in a fight for a first-round bye.<br>	<br>	Again, The Mighty may have the most feasible path, with floundering Odouls and the &rsquo;Shanks on the slate. Should Boom win both of those, all they need is for Jesus to drop one of its final two (and remember, one of those is against the Bensons) and Boom will get in on tiebreakers.<br>	<br>	Odouls must win its final two&mdash;one of them against the best team in the East, the Falcons&mdash;and have Jesus drop one to get in.<br>	<br>	The &rsquo;Shanks need the most help (obviously) as the current cellar-dweller. They must win their final two, which would in turn hand losses to Jesus and Boom, and have Jesus lose its other game against the Bensons. The &rsquo;Shanks would also need Odouls to lose one of its games to either Boom or the Falcons.<br>	<br>	Incredibly, should the likely &ldquo;favorite&rdquo; win each game in the East over the next two weeks (Boom over Odouls, &rsquo;Shanks and Bensons over Jesus, Falcons over Odouls), the Week 13 tilt between archrivals Boom and the &rsquo;Shanks will be for the right to go to the playoffs.<br>	<br>	Should four teams in the East finish with five wins apiece (highly possible), the league will consider renaming the division to &ldquo;2004 Big 12 North.&rdquo;
