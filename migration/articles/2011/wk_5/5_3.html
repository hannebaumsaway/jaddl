	In honor of the second year of interdivisional play, we take a look at how West and East have hooked up through the ages, <i>Deadliest Warrior</i> style.<br>	<br>	But first, let&rsquo;s recap how the Chasm War is going within the JADDL itself. The West is dominating in points, 2,983.7 to 2,813.6. Four West teams have eclipsed the 500-mark (IPA, Tulsa, Hauloll, and OPC), while just two East teams (Bensons and Boom) have done so. The West has three of the Top 5 QBs, four of the Top 5 RBs, <i>and</i> four of the Top 5 WRs.<br>	<br>	In other words, the West is dominating the shit out of the East in every way conceivable. Except for the real-life trophy battle, that is, in which the <a href="http://i133.photobucket.com/albums/q45/kougar24/JADDL/trophy-east-goblet.png">East still leads</a> 1&ndash;0. Get on that, West.<br>	<br>	Now, on to the East vs. West global showdown&hellip;<br>	<br>	<div class="section-head">West Coast vs. East Coast</div><br>	<img alt="" class="cover" style="max-height:250px;" src="http://danjlovesthe90s.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/tupac-biggie.jpg" />	I speak, of course, of the epic rap battle of the early- to mid-90s that provided the soundtrack for the coming-of-age of the owners in this league. The battleground was set when Sean Combs / Puffy / Puff Daddy / P. Diddy / <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWjPVBPTtu8&feature=related">guy-from-<i>Get Him to the Greek</i></a> founded Bad Boy Records in NYC to contend with the L.A.-based Death Row label. When 2Pac was shot in the lobby of an NYC studio in 1994 and accused Puffy and The Notorious B.I.G. of facilitating it, the war was <i>on</i>. Three years later, both 2Pac and Biggie were dead. So who wins this one? Well, 2Pac was killed first (or <i>was</i> he?!), so that would tilt the nod to the East. However, the West has <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNUrkG-H6z0">Snoop</a>. Besides, 2Pac was awesome in <i>Above the Rim</i> prior to kicking the bucket, so&hellip;Advantage: West.<br>	<br>	<div class="section-head">Wicked Witch of the West vs. Wicked Witch of the East</div><br>	<img alt="" class="cover" style="max-height:250px;" src="http://images2.fanpop.com/images/photos/5300000/The-Wicked-Witch-of-the-West-the-wizard-of-oz-5305819-316-368.jpg" />	Tough call here. Like the rappers above, both characters end up dead before all is said and done. Also, they were sisters, and didn&rsquo;t really have a battle going on between them, though it turned out the bitchy West witch <i>did</i> covet her sister&rsquo;s gawdy shoes. It&rsquo;s not real cool that her primary concern upon her sister&rsquo;s demise was a cheap pair of hooker heels. But what am I saying? The Wicked Witch of the West flew around on a broom, lived in a sweet castle, set one of the protagonists on fire, and commanded a legion of evil flying monkeys before meeting her maker. The Wicked Witch of the East didn&rsquo;t so much as get out a token line of dialogue before getting fucking crushed by a rickety old farm house. Advantage: West.<br>	<br>	<div class="section-head">Wild Wild West vs. Far East</div><br>	<img alt="" class="cover" style="max-height:250px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5Md7Ko9YHNM/Tb2mGBKkVrI/AAAAAAAAAmQ/165F5rRiV1U/s1600/cowboy%2Bvs%2BninjaA.jpg" />	Probably the most hotly contested battle of them all. If we&rsquo;re talking a true <i>Deadliest Warrior</i> face-off here, who wins? Would the cowboy win due to possession of guns? Or would the cowboy get a shuriken in the neck before he even knew he was in a fight? The West has <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wd99TRgYgA&feature=watch_response_rev">Clint Eastwood</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkkYHH7oYp4">John Wayne</a>, <i>The Magnificent Seven</i> and <i>Tombstone</i>. The East has <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USlnfTGlhXc">Bruce Lee</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4mUehKrefg&feature=results_main&playnext=1&list=PLC7A11690200AE2E2">David Carradine</a>, <i>Enter the Dragon</i> and <i>Kung Fu</i>. Oooo, such a hard choice! But, in the end, I have to go with my gut, and my gut tells me that in a streetfight, a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtR2m20C2YM">ninja</a> would fuck up a cowboy six ways to Sunday. Also, <i>Samurai Jack</i> was a kick-ass cartoon. Advantage: East.<br>	<br>	<div class="section-head">&ldquo;California Girls&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;Empire State of Mind&rdquo;</div><br>	<img alt="" class="cover" style="max-height:250px;" src="http://www.pifemaster.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/jay-z-alicia-keys-empire-state-of-mind-pittsburgh-version.jpg" />	Do I really need to delve into this &ldquo;battle&rdquo;? Let&rsquo;s see&hellip;Jay-Z married way up when he hooked <a href="http://youtu.be/GMaW_g243VA?t=15s">Beyonce</a>. Katy Perry&hellip;Russell Brand? Seriously? I mean, the guy is pretty funny and all, but&hellip;<i>Russell Brand?</i> Perry did loop Snoop into her video, but I&rsquo;m not sure Perry + Snoop > Jay-Z + Alicia Keys. Katy Perry does have huge&hellip;tracts of land&hellip;but again, Jay-Z landed a girl with huge&hellip;tracts of land&hellip;and we all can safely assume Jay-Z himself has a huge&hellip;ego. Oh, and have I mentioned yet? &ldquo;California Girls&rdquo; makes me want to stab my eardrums out with one of Katy Perry&rsquo;s boob cones, while I am not ashamed to admit I do <i>not</i> change the station when &ldquo;Empire State of Mind&rdquo; comes on. Advantage: East.<br><br>	<div class="section-head">Setting Sun vs. Rising Sun</div><br>	<img alt="" class="cover" style="max-height:250px;" src="http://image.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/294373/294373,1228632592,1/stock-photo-vertical-banners-with-rising-sun-setting-sun-daytime-and-moon-21641917.jpg" />	The tiebreaker! Alright, so what does the setting sun represent? An end to the workday, perhaps&mdash;like that tool you undoubtedly work with tells you at least once a week, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s five o&rsquo;clock somewhere! Yuk yuk&hellip;&rdquo;&mdash;or the start of a fun evening. It signals to the locals that it&rsquo;s now socially acceptable to drink booze and get a little crazy. It lets nocturnal creatures know that dinner time rapidly approaches. But the setting sun can also put an end to a day on the lake or a golf outing. If it&rsquo;s a Sunday, it can signal the end of the weekend and the impending doom of another week at the office. It smugly reminds you of all the things you were supposed to get done today, but didn&rsquo;t. And what about the rising sun? The beginning to a brand new day full of possibilities. The cue for you to start inhaling splendid caffeine as if there was no tomorrow, because hey, why do you need tomorrow? Today has just begun! The rising sun can be a beacon guiding you to the lake or the links for a seemingly eternal day of leisure, or simply the undying pleasure of bacon and eggs. But the rising sun can also trigger 8+ hours of cubicle hell ahead of you, or the arrival of a deadline you&rsquo;ve been dreading for weeks. It can put the final nail in your procrastination coffin since that report is due&mdash;gasp!&mdash;today! Plus, you now know you have several hours before boozing is socially acceptable. So, with all those things considered&hellip;ah, fuck it; a draw!<br>	<br>	That&rsquo;s right, I took the pussy way out; <a href="http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lkbummj8d71qhsqy6o1_400.gif">deal with it</a>. Settle it on the field over the next three weeks!
