	<div class="game-header">In Pursuit of Perfection 79.9&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Tulsa Angry Monkeys 124.8</div>	The Monkeys continue to roll, racking up their 2nd Briefly Badass award in as many weeks. Drafting Aaron Rodgers was not dumb. As for the defending champs, that's their 2nd <i>loss</i> in as many weeks, and drafting Joseph Addai and Ryan Grant may have been dumb.
<br>
<br>	<b>Reich&rsquo;s Pick: Monkeys (-6.6) <span style="color:#55aa55">/WIN</span></b><br>	<div class="pick-revisited"></div>
<br><br>	<div class="game-header">Red Hornets 69.5&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;The IPA Connoisseur 118.7</div>	Going up against the hapless Hornets, IPA didn't <i>need</i> to put up a good number, but they did anyway. The 49ers D/ST? Well played, Lannie, well played.
<br>
<br>	<b>Reich&rsquo;s Pick: Connoisseur (+8.4) <span style="color:#55aa55">/WIN</span></b><br>	<div class="pick-revisited"></div>
<br><br>	<div class="game-header">Team Hauloll 82.3&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;One Pump Chumps 90.3</div>	So far, OPC's Cammy Cam acquisition has been the waiver wire pickup of the year. The Chumps needed nearly all his 25.5 points to secure a victory in a mundane game over Hauloll.
<br><br>	<b>Reich&rsquo;s Pick: Hauloll (+3.7) <span style="color:#aa5555">/FAIL</span></b><br>	<div class="pick-revisited"></div>
<br><br>	<div class="game-header">The Lawrence Football Jesus 62.0&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Team Odouls 99.6</div>	Michael &ldquo;Kibbles And&rdquo; Vick did his thing for Jesus, but he was all alone. James has plenty of choices for his Shitball of the Week dishonor. Odouls used an 80-yard TD scamper from Jahvid Best to run up the score. Classless!
<br><br>	<b>Reich&rsquo;s Pick: Jesus (-7.8) <span style="color:#aa5555">/FAIL</span></b><br>	<div class="pick-revisited"></div>
<br><br>	<div class="game-header">Millennium Falcons 66.7&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mighty Boom 69.7</div>	What a horrible game. The Titans D/ST scores -2 for Boom, so the Bucs D/ST puts up -8 for the Falcons? 136.4 total points? This was what @sportspickle would call an &ldquo;old-fashioned suck-off.&rdquo;
<br><br>	<b>Reich&rsquo;s Pick: Boom (-8.0) <span style="color:#aa5555">/FAIL</span></b>
