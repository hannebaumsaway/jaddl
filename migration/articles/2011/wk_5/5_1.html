	It&rsquo;s hard to be positive about 1-4. Really fucking hard.<br>	<br>	The Philadelphia Eagles are 1-4; their fans are foaming at the mouth for Andy Reid&rsquo;s head. The Vikings are 1-4, too; they have Adrian Peterson&rsquo;s dad calling into radio shows complaining about his son&rsquo;s lack of carries. Jacksonville fans would be pissed at their 1-4 start as well, if Jacksonville had any fans. Arizona Cardinals fans have completely missed their 1-4 start, being on Mountain Time and all.<br>	<br>	Only Carolina and Denver have managed upbeat 1-4 runs. Carolina has been infused with Cammy Cam Juice, so their optimism is understandable. As for Denver&hellip;well, a) no one sucks more tantalizingly than Tim Tebow, and b) Denver fans are idiots.<br>	<br>	Sure, one can say things like, <i>Hey, it&rsquo;s better than 0-5!</i> or <i>They&rsquo;re learning how to win!</i> But only the former statement is true when it comes to the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks. 1-4 <i>is</i> better than 0-5&mdash;just ask the Red Hornets&mdash;but the &rsquo;Shanks did nothing differently to earn a win in Week 5 than they did when racking up losses in the first four weeks of the season.<br>	<br>	The &rsquo;Shanks have been consistently decent in 2011: they&rsquo;re exceedingly average in the points race (7th) with the third smallest range between highest and lowest scores. Could they be more powerful? Sure. But they&rsquo;re plenty good enough not to be in the East cellar heading into interdivisional play.<br>	<div class='news-quote'>Hey, fellow East owners: Boom is the one you want! Take your torches and pitchforks his way!<div class='author'>Ryan</div></div><br>	Nevertheless, in the East cellar they sit.<br>	<br>	Why? Because they have a target on their backs the size of Mark Mangino&rsquo;s left man-boob. The Longshanks have narrowly missed out on the playoffs the past two seasons after going their first six seasons without missing the postseason once. The other franchises smell blood in the water, sense an opportunity to knock a dynasty off its pedestal. Everyone loves to see an underdog rise up, right? Well, everyone loves to see a big dog fall, too.<br>	<br>	Not convinced? Consider the following&hellip;<br>	<br>	Out of the five teams the &rsquo;Shanks have played to date, one team had its best outing (Odouls) and three had their second best (Jesus, Boom, and the Falcons). All four of those teams scored well above their season averages against the Oppressor of the Scots&mdash;19.4 points above their averages, on average. (Getting sick of the word <i>average</i> yet?)<br>	<br>	Only once have the &rsquo;Shanks gotten an opponent&rsquo;s average shot, and that was against the Bad News Bensons this week. The result? A 97.3&ndash;92.5 victory. With that outcome, the final JADDL unbeaten has fallen, and the 13-and-0 Watch is on hold for yet another year. The game came down to the wire on Monday night, with Bensons kicker Jason Hanson (Detroit) the last man standing, needing 11 points to steal the win. It looked as if it was destined to happen, too. Detroit was driving to set up a long end-of-half field goal try before Matt Stafford was intercepted. In the 3rd quarter, the Lions got to the Chicago 30-yard-line before a hands-to-the-face penalty forced them back out of field goal range. Hanson finally got a 31-yard FG near the end of the game, but it was too little, too late, and the &rsquo;Shanks caught a break for the first time this season.<br>	<br>	&ldquo;When did we become the Yankees or KU basketball?&rdquo; Ryan threw up his hands exasperatedly at the podium following Monday night&rsquo;s long-awaited win. &ldquo;Hey, fellow East owners: Boom is the one you want! Take your torches and pitchforks his way!&rdquo;<br>	<br>	Perhaps the West owners will be kinder to the &rsquo;Shanks as the JADDL enters its second annual interdivisional stretch. But kindness isn&rsquo;t likely to come next weekend, as the Longshanks travel to Wichita to take on the league points leader, The IPA Connoisseur. It&rsquo;s doubtful IPA will sympathize with the Longshanks&rsquo; plight, considering they are 0-3 lifetime against the East franchise. But it&rsquo;s years like this that are made for such streaks to be put to bed.<br>	<br>	Said Lannie simply, following his beatdown of the winless Red Hornets: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re aware of our record against [the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks],&rdquo;  unable to keep a devious grin from tugging ever so slightly at the corner of his mouth.<br>	<br>	Just like 1-4 looks a lot better than 0-5, 2-4 looks a <i>hell</i> of a lot better than 1-5. But considering the circumstances, Ryan will likely be consoling himself next Monday night with the fact that 6-7 teams <i>have</i> made the playoffs in the past.
