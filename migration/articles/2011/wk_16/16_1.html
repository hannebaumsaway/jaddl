	At ease, 2003. Your nostalgia services are no longer required.<br>	<br>	The One Pump Chumps are champions again for the first time since the inaugural year of the Ragin&rsquo; Black Squirrels Association, joining the Red Hornets and Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks in the rarified air of multiple-season winners. The accomplishment came in Jared Bowl V, in the form of a 130.5&ndash;95.6 victory over The Mighty Boom.<br>	<br>	That score set two JADDL records: one for most points scored by a team in the Jared Bowl, and another for largest margin of victory in the Jared Bowl. Those stats make for lively dinner conversation, and they tie a nice bow around a hell of a season for the Chumps.<br>	<br>	Virtual Vermeil. Jared&rsquo;s Goblet. Court-Ordered Limousine. 270 bucks for Jesse. Yes, a hell of a season indeed.<br>	<br>	But in order to take all those steps forward, OPC had to start by taking a rather significant step back.<br>	<br>	In Week 1, the Chumps scored the fewest points in the league (72.4), which set them up for first dibs in 2011&rsquo;s initial waiver wire frenzy. That waiver wire pick was the most important choice Jesse has ever had&mdash;within the context of fantasy football, of course&mdash;and he chose wisely.<br>	<br>	Into Manhattan and the OPC locker room flew Cameron &ldquo;Cammy Cam&rdquo; Newton, and with him, OPC would go 9-2 after a 1-1 start. That sounds impressive enough by itself, but Cammy Cam looks damn near like a gift from heaven when you consider the fact that he replaced Donovan McNabb and the corpse of Peyton Manning. Where would the Chumps have been without Newton considering whom their alternatives were? You&rsquo;d be hard pressed to find a gambling man who would have even put them in the playoffs, let alone the Jared Bowl.<br>	<br>	As added perspective, the next QB taken off waivers was Kyle Orton, three weeks later. Would a Kyle Orton-led Chumps squad make a title run? Eh&hellip;<br>	<br>	&ldquo;There is no way on God&rsquo;s green earth we win this thing without Cammy,&rdquo; said a jubilant Jesse following OPC&rsquo;s triumph. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like you all to believe that Week 1 clunker was by design once I realized Peyton was done. Will you believe that?&rdquo;<br><br>	<a class="lightbox" target="_blank" href="assets/images/players/2011/chumps_jonesdrew.jpg"><img alt="" class="cover-left" src="assets/images/players/2011/chumps_jonesdrew.jpg" /></a>	No. But it&rsquo;s okay to accept Lady Luck&rsquo;s help en route to the promised land; every champion has. Besides, OPC&rsquo;s prowess didn&rsquo;t lie with Newton alone. Including Newton, the Chumps started five top-10 skill players in the Jared Bowl. RB bannermen Maurice Jones-Drew and Reggie Bush combined for 32.3 points in the Jared Bowl, and Jonathan Stewart pitched in another 15.9.<br>	<br>	But, in the end, the night was drenched in Cammy Cam Juice&hellip;35.3 points&rsquo; worth. That tally broke the Jared Bowl&rsquo;s individual scoring record, which stood for three years after the Longshanks&rsquo; DeAngelo Williams hung 34.8 on Team Odouls in 2008.<br>	<br>	Following the game, Newton decided to share his life story over the P.A. system for all his adoring fans.<br>	<br>	&ldquo;Ha! I get paid to go to Auburn and get away with it, win a national title there, get to the pros and make stacks of cash and get my toes licked by beautiful women, and now I stand atop the JADDL! C.C. Juice for all!&rdquo;<br><br>	<a class="lightbox" target="_blank" href="assets/images/players/2011/chumps_yes_we_cam.jpg"><img alt="" class="cover" src="assets/images/players/2011/chumps_yes_we_cam.jpg" /></a>	Alas, for every victor, there must be a loser. While the confetti continued to fall on the field outside, Peter huddled with his team in the Boom locker room. Since winning it all in the final year of the RBSA in &rsquo;06, The Mighty has made the playoffs four times in five opportunities. In the previous three, they fell a game short of the Jared Bowl. Finally, in their worst season of the four record-wise, they get to the final stage only to be humiliated by the league&rsquo;s top dog from the regular season.<br>	<br>	After the game, Peter was asked if a 6-7 team can <i>really</i> be that disappointed in a Jared Bowl loss.<br>	<br>	&ldquo;Fuck you,&rdquo; Peter replied.<br>	<br>	So, after one of the more entertaining and competitive JADDL seasons to date, another long, cold off-season awaits. This hiatus brings with it bragging rights for a couple franchises, as both the Chumps and the Bad News Bensons climb into the top four of the league in terms of prestige, supplanting the flailing Hornets and &rsquo;Shanks. Boom remains the league&rsquo;s only five-star club, though that will do little to fill the hole in Peter&rsquo;s trophy case that was reserved for this year&rsquo;s Limo.<br>	<br>	Today, however, is about Jesse and his Chumps. About a RBSA founding father biding his time and quietly piling up wins until his time came again.<br>	<br>	Remember when Jesse won it all in 2003? No, of course you don&rsquo;t. And now you don&rsquo;t need to.<br>	<br>	Because you&rsquo;ll remember 2011 for years to come. Jesse will make sure of that.
