	<div class="game-header">One Pump Chumps 112.1&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Team Hauloll 102.5</div>	Nothing feels better than entering Monday Night Football armed only with a kicker, and riding that kicker to sweet victory over a helpless, playerless opponent. Jesse did just that with Robbie &ldquo;Pure&rdquo; Gould&rsquo;s 15 MNF points to erase a 5.4-point deficit. Hauloll has now lost two straight to fall two games behind&hellip;

<br><br>	<div class="game-header">The IPA Connoisseur 96.7&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Red Hornets 91.3</div>	Dan continues to thrive with the anticipation and arrival of the conclusion of Daylight Savings Time, but it wasn&rsquo;t enough to take down the dominant 2011 seasonal brew IPA. Close only counts in horseshoes, hand grenades, and Wall Street accounting.

<br><br>	<div class="game-header">Tulsa Angry Monkeys 105.9&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;In Pursuit of Perfection 78.2</div>	Jacob returned to his winning ways to stay within a game of IPA, thanks to yet another stellar performance from Brett Favre&rsquo;s former understudy (seriously, that&rsquo;s hilarious to think about in hindsight). On the IPP side, an RB duo of Ryan Grant and Jackie Battle <i>probably</i> isn&rsquo;t going to take Nolan where he wants to go. The chances of finally getting a repeat JADDL champ look dim.

<br><br>	<div class="game-header">Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks 96.2&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bad News Bensons 48.4</div>	The &rsquo;Shanks finally catch a break with regard to an opponent&rsquo;s score. The Bensons have been getting nothing but bad news on the injury front lately, forcing him to pick up&mdash;and play&mdash;guys like Kevin &ldquo;Y2K&rdquo; Faulk and Javon Ringer. The Bensons had two players (Faulk and Darrius Heyward-Michael-Bey) put up goose eggs, and they outscored the Raiders D/ST by five.

<br><br>	<div class="game-header">Team Odouls 64.4&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lawrence Football Jesus 61.4</div>	A crappy game that evened these two teams&rsquo; records up at 4-5. James better hope Vick steps it up, or he&rsquo;ll be adding &ldquo;Worst #1 Pick Ever&rdquo; to his long list of <i>un</i>accolades.
