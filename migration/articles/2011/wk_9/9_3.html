	<i>&hellip;The first thing that he&rsquo;d like to do&hellip;<br>	<br>	Is to save&hellip;every day&hellip;&rsquo;til eternity passes away&hellip;<br>	<br>	Just to spend them with Arian Foster&hellip;</i><br>	<br>	No, but seriously guys, is it coincidence that the Red Hornets started playing better as we approached the end of Daylight Savings Time? I think not. Here in the JADDL, we don&rsquo;t believe in coincidences. Only hexes, curses, bizarro universes, voodoo magic, and Jared Allen&rsquo;s former mullet (R.I.P.!).<br>	<br>	As you are aware, if you live in a normal state that adheres to the principle of Daylight Savings Time&mdash;as opposed to a weirdo state that doesn&rsquo;t&mdash;DST came to an end this past Sunday morning. For us normal peeps, that meant walking around the house, turning all the clocks back an hour, and welcoming darkness on our drives home from work.<br>	<br>	For those weirdos in, say, Arizona, it meant <i>gaining</i> an hour relative to us normies. One member of the weirdo population is especially elated at this phenomenon: our own Daywalker Dan, owner of the Red Hornets. Dan is under the impression that his time zone puts him at a disadvantage when it comes to roster moves, as NFL games occur earlier for him relative to the rest of the league. Of course, this theory of his conveniently ignores the fact that one of the league&rsquo;s most prestigious franchises, Team Hauloll, resides mere miles away from Dan&rsquo;s own.<br>	<br>	Be that as it may, the impending end to Daylight Savings Time has clearly brought about a change in the Hornets&rsquo; play on the imaginary field.<br>	<br>	Through the first six weeks of the season&mdash;all losses&mdash;the Hornets failed to eclipse the 90-point mark a single time. In fact, they only hit the 80s once.<br>	<br>	In the past three weeks, as we&rsquo;ve approached DST&rsquo;s demise, the &rsquo;Nets have passed 90 in each game&hellip;hitting triple figures in two of them.<br>	<br>	&ldquo;Yo, hey! Yeah, I&rsquo;m ready to chat! You bet! What was the question?&rdquo; said Dan on Tuesday&rsquo;s league conference call. &ldquo;Has the end of Daylight Savings Time helped us? Yeah! I&rsquo;m so alert now, roster moves are a breeze! I even have time for coffee beforehand!&rdquo;<br>	<br>	Not sure how alert one needs to be to think to himself, <i>Welp, I should start Arian Foster today,</i> but to each his own.<br>	<br>	Of course, lost in all this is the fact that Dan&rsquo;s two wins came in interdivisional play against the pathetic East. Then again, the Hornets did score 101.6 and 110.8 in those victories, so he would have beaten a lot of teams those days.<br>	<br>	Thus, we come back to the conclusion of Daylight Savings as the cure for what ailed Dan and his Crimson Stingers.<br>	<br>	Good morning, Phoenix.
