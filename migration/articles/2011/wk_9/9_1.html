	Somewhere along the way to second place in the East, Ian became the dumpster-diving housewife who searches other people&rsquo;s garbage for unused coupons, literally turning their trash into cash at the grocery store. They call it &ldquo;extreme couponing.&rdquo; I call it &ldquo;homelessness training.&rdquo;<br>	<br>	What Ian&rsquo;s doing is the free agency / waiver wire / trade equivalent in fantasy football&hellip;<i>extreme freeagenwaiverading.</i><br>	<br>	<i>Navigating through the waiver wire ain&rsquo;t like dustin&rsquo; crops, boy.</i> Without precise research and football instincts, you could fly right past the next 2010 Michael Vick, or settle on Kyle Orton, and your season would be over real quick, wouldn&rsquo;t it?<br>	<br>	Well, Ian&mdash;as the only owner/GM in the JADDL who played competitive reality football beyond high school&mdash;has those football instincts in spades, and he uses them fully. <i>Hokey religions</i>&mdash;cough&hellip;Football Jesus&mdash;<i>and ancient weapons are no match for Division 1-A experience at your side, kid.</i><br>	<br>	In the words of Duracell, consider this: in the Millennium Falcons&rsquo; resounding 137.5&ndash;93.7 win over The Once Mighty Boom, only three of the Falcons&rsquo; nine starters were players Ian drafted at the beginning of the season&hellip;and of those three, one was a D/ST (the Eagles&rsquo;), which hardly counts. Matt Ryan and Greg Jennings were the other two.<br>	<div class='news-quote'>Look, I ain&rsquo;t in this for [my sister&rsquo;s] revolution, and I&rsquo;m not in it for her&hellip;I expect to be well paid.<div class='author'>Ian</div></div><br>	The other six starters were all acquired during the season at one time or another. The Falcons got double-digit production from waiver wire warriors DeMarco Murray (18.6), homer pick Eric Decker (10.7), and Nick Novak (11).<br>	<br>	Then we come to the truly masterful stuff. On October 25th, a intra-extended-family trade was executed which sent Montario Hardesty and Demaryius Thomas from the Falcons to the Bad News Bensons in exchange for Julio Jones and Michael Bush. Both Jones and Bush had byes in Week 8, but you see above what they did in Week 9 upon their return. Alex had given up on them due to nagging injuries and general lack of produciton. As you can see, he gave up on them too soon.<br>	<br>	<i>The League has no time for owners who drop their players at the first sign of trouble.</i><br>	<br>	Bush is now the feature back in Chokeland while Run DMC chills in the infirmary, and Jones showed a belated proficiency for TD catches in his first game back from injury. To add to the pain for Alex, Ian is suddenly his primary competitor for the Eastern Goblet.<br>	<br>	When asked about his desire to overtake first place in the division and what that would mean for his sister, who happens to be Alex&rsquo;s wife, Ian said, &ldquo;Look, I ain&rsquo;t in this for her revolution, and I&rsquo;m not in it for her&hellip;I expect to be well paid.<br>	<br>	&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in it for the money!&rdquo;<br>	<br>	<i>That&rsquo;s great, kid. But don&rsquo;t get cocky.</i><br>	<br>	Arrogance may be inevitable after bringing home the Briefly Badass title this past week en route to his second-place ascension, though. Time to see if he can close the deal. Last year the Falcons finished the regular season losing four of their last six. This year&mdash;at least for now&mdash;they look strong enough to pull the ears off a gundark.
