	<i>Jake Gutierrez kindly agreed to help the commissioner award the Torn Hoodie this year by offering up an objective, team-by-team evaluation of the draft. How&rsquo;d he do? Let&rsquo;s find out&hellip;</i><br><br>	<br><br><br>	<span class="draft-grade">A+</span> <span class="draft-team">The Bad News Bensons</span><br>    Good RB depth, has the 2 best offensive rookies in the game. Expect Brees to have a bounce back year and I think Ahmad Bradshaw will have a huge year. No dominating WR but I like the talent all the way through.<br>	<br>	<div class="pick-revisited">It&rsquo;s probably a good omen when your overall draft winner and A+ grade recipient wins its division, as the Bensons did. Drew Brees finished the regular season 3rd among QBs, but Ahmad Bradshaw was fairly average. As for the rookies, Mark Ingram was average as well, and Julio Jones didn&rsquo;t make it as a Benson, doing his damage instead with the Falcons&hellip;minimal damage.</div><br><br>	<span class="draft-grade">A</span> <span class="draft-team">Team Hauloll</span><br>	Love the top 3 RBs. Good QBs but no gamebreaker at WR . <br>	<br>	<div class="pick-revisited">Uh oh. An A grade to a non-playoff team? Hi Chris Johnson, nice of you to show up in Week 10. DeAngelo Williams never got going either. McGahee was on track to do well until his injury. Wes Welker turned out to <i>be</i> a gamebreaking WR, but he was alone in that regard.</div><br><br>	<span class="draft-grade">A-</span> <span class="draft-team">Millennium Falcons</span><br>	Best RB in the game. I love the Nicks/Jennings combo but no solid #3 WR.<br>	<br>	<div class="pick-revisited">A.D. was definitely in the running for best RB in the game until he went down. The Nicks/Jennings combo was indeed a good one as well, while Decker did turn out to be a solid #3 receiver. Another good grade given to a good team, though the DeMarco Murray waiver pickup helped significantly here.</div><br><br>	<span class="draft-grade">B+</span> <span class="draft-team">The IPA Connoisseur</span><br>	Good top 3 RBs, I really like Schaub but very young WRs. If Britt can stay off the weed then this could be a solid WR core. I think Greg Olson could be a sleeper TE.<br>	<br>	<div class="pick-revisited">Good top 3 RBs? I&rsquo;ll say. Britt stayed off the weed but couldn&rsquo;t stay <i>on</i> the field, nonetheless. Schaub had a nice thing going before his own injury, but Greg Olsen&hellip;was <i>not</i> a sleeper TE. He sucked. All in all though, another playoff team awarded a decent grade. The beat goes on.</div><br><br>	<span class="draft-grade">B</span> <span class="draft-team">Team Odouls</span><br>	Almost graded this team down to a D- because of the weak ass team name. Couldn&rsquo;t do it to a team with the best WR in the game. Love Mendenhall; also might have the best D/ST in the Packers. I am a fan of Flacco but I think Daniel Thomas in 6th round is a huge stretch. Must be an EcoKat fan&hellip;<br>	<br>	<div class="pick-revisited">Another grade soiled by injury, this time to Andre Johnson. If Calvin is Megatron, Andre was a Gobot this year, thanks to many, many weeks on the shelf. Mendenhall got way too much love, though, and skewed this grade higher than it should have been for a 5-8 team. As did Flacco, needless to say. Daniel Thomas is probably right where he should be for a 6th round pick. At the very least, it wasn&rsquo;t a <i>huge</i> stretch, in the end. Go EcoKats! Cough cough&hellip;10-2&hellip;cough&hellip;</div><br><br>	<span class="draft-grade">B-</span> <span class="draft-team">Red Hornets</span><br>	Good value picks with Benson and Ricky Williams, especially with Foster&rsquo;s health in question. A little early for Romo but I really like Bradford as the backup. If Maclin doesn&rsquo;t have AIDS the WR core has the potential to be really good.<br>	<br>	<div class="pick-revisited">Freaking nailed the &ldquo;Foster&rsquo;s health in question&rdquo; part, didn&rsquo;t he? Bradford sucked beyond our wildest expectations, but Romo actually faired pretty well. Maclin doesn&rsquo;t have AIDS (as far as we know), but his shoulder is dangling by a thread, so the Hornets&rsquo; WR corps did end up being crap. Again, B- is too high for a 4-9 squad.</div><br><br>	<span class="draft-grade">C+</span> <span class="draft-team">In Pursuit of Perfection LLC</span><br>	How can I not love Jam Chuck with the 1st pick? And rounds the RB stable with two solid 1st-stringers. Possibly the top WR core in the league with Megatron at the head of the crew. Also has my favorite TE in the league. Jay Cutler worries me with all the INTs he throws but has the potential to be a top 8 guy if he can control the picks.<br>	<br>	<div class="pick-revisited">Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you how you can not love Jam Chuck with the first pick&hellip;Anyhoo, Grant and Addai were anything <i>but</i> solid 1st-stringers, but IPP&rsquo;s WR corps was stout indeed. Jay Cutler&hellip;was not a top 8 guy.</div><br><br>	<span class="draft-grade">C</span> <span class="draft-team">The Mighty Boom</span><br>	Good starting RBs and 2 solid backups. The name of this team should be changed to &ldquo;The Sleepers.&rdquo; I think Brandon Pettigrew is a huge sleeper and poised to have a big year if Stafford can stay healthy. Also I&rsquo;m a big fan of Roy Helu (even though he is a dumbass Husker). Danny Amendola and Greg Little are solid late picks and have the potential to be big players. This team has the best WRs top to bottom. If you need WRs later in the season this is the guy you should be sending trades to.<br>	<br>	<div class="pick-revisited">Nailed it on the RBs, but &ldquo;The Sleepers&rdquo; never really woke up. It turns out, LeSean McCoy and Tom Brady are quite literally all you needed to make the playoffs in the East this season.</div><br><br>	<span class="draft-grade">C-</span> <span class="draft-team">Tulsa Angry Monkeys</span><br>	Best QB in the game but in a league that only gets 4 points for Pass TDs the value of the QB drops slightly. Love the 1st four picks but after that the draft fell off. No legit #2 RB and I think by the end of the year the law firm BGE won&rsquo;t be starting for the Pats. Vernon Davis is a top 3 TE but Tulsa will depend on a crappy 49ers team for 2 of his 9 starting spots.<br>	<br>	<div class="pick-revisited">Turns out, Discount Doublecheck is good enough to carry a team even in a 4-points-per-TD-pass league. The Monkeys&rsquo; first four picks (Doublecheck, Gore, Fitzgerald, Bryant) were pretty solid indeed. Guti clearly underestimated Marshawn Lynch, but then again, who didn&rsquo;t? The Monkeys, that&rsquo;s who. A C- for the #2 team in the JADDL&rsquo;s top division is quite harsh. Never undervalue the Discount Doublecheck, Jake.</div><br><br>	<span class="draft-grade">D</span> <span class="draft-team">Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks</span><br>	Hate Ryan Mathews and lukewarm on Knowshon Moreno. Roddy White is solid but Brandon Marshall and Steve Smith are #3 fantasy WRs. Has the top Kicker in the league though&hellip;<br>	<br>	<div class="pick-revisited">Switch the above to &ldquo;Hate Knowshon Moreno and lukewarm on Ryan Mathews&rdquo; and Guti would have a future in fortunetelling. Steve Smith rode Cammy Cam&rsquo;s arm to a top 10 ranking, but Roddy unexpectedly did not. Marshall was exactly what Jake said he was: a #3 WR. It&rsquo;s sad that he had to resort to commenting on the kicker&hellip;the &rsquo;Shanks should have known what they were in for this season based on that alone.</div><br><br>	<span class="draft-grade">D</span> <span class="draft-team">The Lawrence Football Jesus</span><br>	Not a Vick fan especially in the 1st round of a league that only gives 4 points for Passing TDs and then to waste a middle round pick with a back-up QB is why this team earned a D. This ream does have 2 solid RBs but LT is worthless and past his prime. Is going to be in trouble when Blount and Wells are on bye weeks. Might have the best TE in the league but that&rsquo;s about it.<br>	<br>	<div class="pick-revisited">The Football Jesus isn&rsquo;t a Vick fan now, either. Wells was a solid RB, and Blount had his ups and downs, but Antonio Gates was a huge let-down.</div><br><br>	<span class="draft-grade">F</span> <span class="draft-team">One Pump Chumps</span><br>	This grade was given before Manning was even ruled out but after that news it should be a F-. Very down on MJD and you should probably drop Rashad Jennings considering he is on IR. With 8 guys in the box Jacksonville will struggle to run the ball. Your 2nd drafted RB is a back-up. Starting McNabb is not a good thing. About the only thing I like about this team is Reggie Bush. I think he is going to have a big year.<br>	<br>	<div class="pick-revisited">Uh oh. An F grade to the top team in the league. To be fair, this grade didn&rsquo;t take into consideration the eventual Cammy Cam waiver wire pickup, which was obviously significant. Very down on MJD though? He broke into the top 5 among RBs. Reggie Bush did have a pretty big year, for Reggie Bush.</div>
