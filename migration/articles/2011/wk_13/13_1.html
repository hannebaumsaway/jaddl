	Hello Playoffs; you look different&hellip;did you get a haircut or something?

	No Team Hauloll. No Team Odouls. No Red Hornets. No Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks.<br>	<br>	This can&rsquo;t be the playoffs, can it? It doesn&rsquo;t smell right. Four of the five most prestigious franchises in the JADDL, home for the holidays? Madness!<br>	<br>	Or is it?<br>	<br>	Last year, three of the Big Five missed the postseason. Team Hauloll and The Mighty Boom were the ones who qualified.<br>	<br>	This year, only Boom carries the torch. Maybe this isn&rsquo;t some bizarre anomaly. Maybe it&rsquo;s a culture shift in the league. In a few years, the rankings in terms of franchise prestige may look drastically different than they do today. And that&rsquo;s quite alright.<br>	<br>	It&rsquo;s also common. Remember when the Cowboys and <i>Bills</i> dominated the NFL scene? Ha, I know, right? And the Patriots were a patsy. The Pistons were an NBA dynasty once. Notre Dame? Kids today are confused when Coach Parseghian says &ldquo;As you know, we&rsquo;re competing for a championship every year&rdquo; in <i>Rudy</i>. They laugh hesitantly, not sure if that&rsquo;s supposed to be a joke.<br>	<br>	Here in the JADDL, a quiet revolution seems to be taking place.<br>	<br>	The Bad News Bensons just won their second consecutive Eastern Goblet after going 2-11 in 2009. The Millennium Falcons are on their way to their second playoff appearance in just three years of existence, improving their record each successive season.<br>	<br>	In the West, the Chumps just won 10 games for the second time in three years and are headed to the postseason for the fourth time in five years. The Chumps are rarely recognized as a formidable franchise, but there they sit. The Angry Monkeys are headed to their first-ever playoffs. Hilarious, yes, but what&rsquo;s past is past&hellip;the Monkeys put together a really solid, workmanlike 2011 campaign. And despite a late-season stall, The IPA Connoisseur is moving on for just the second time in franchise history.<br>	<br>	Boom still managed to sneak its way into the playoffs, and a first-ever miss is obviously not enough to sound the alarms in Phoenix for Hauloll, but things are definitely shaking up within the JADDL landscape.<br>	<br>	As Texas &ldquo;reporter&rdquo; Chip Brown frequently said about NCAA conference realignment, the situation is <i>fluid.</i>
