	<div class="game-header">The Mighty Boom 136.1&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Fightin' Longshanks 102.6</div>
	We&rsquo;ll see how they do in the dreaded semis next week, where they have yet to win since the JADDL&rsquo;s inception, but Boom freaking took care of <i>bidness</i> with their backs against the wall to close out the regular season. Fueled by huge numbers from LeSean DeRunningback McCoy, Shonn &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me Shawn&rdquo; Greene, and, uh, Percy Harvin, Boom punched its ticket against its arch rival, the &rsquo;Shanks. In a must-win situation, The Mighty posted their highest score of the season, which forced Jesus into a must-win of its own. We all know how that turned out&hellip;

<br>	<div class="game-header">Team Hauloll 108.2&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;In Pursuit of Perfection 111.2</div>
	This game meant absolutely nothing, but maybe a nice win over the West&rsquo;s premiere dynasty will give IPP fans a sense of calm heading into their final weeks as defending champs. It&rsquo;s sad that it was pointless, too, because this was a great game to &ldquo;watch.&rdquo;

<br><br>	<div class="game-header">Red Hornets 59.8&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;One Pump Chumps 156.0</div>	Coming into this game, the Chumps hadn&rsquo;t <i>quite</i> locked up Jared&rsquo;s Goblet yet. In order to do so, they had to win or&mdash;in a loss&mdash;keep the Monkeys from erasing a 36-point scoring deficit. You know how you handle that scenario? Score one hundred fifty-six fucking points. Jared&rsquo;s Goblet: secured.

<br><br>	<div class="game-header">The IPA Connoisseur 95.8&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Tulsa Angry Monkeys 117.6</div>	On the flip side of the Jared&rsquo;s Goblet duel sat the Angry Monkeys, who needed to win and cover a sizeable points gap in order to have a shot. 117.6 isn&rsquo;t a bad effort toward that goal, even though it fell woefully short thanks to the Chumps&rsquo; explosion. If Marshawn Lynch keeps pace with Discount Doublecheck Rodgers in the postseason, the Monkeys might make a couple opponents <i>extremely</i> angry indeed. As for IPA&hellip;well, maybe they&rsquo;re just getting some losses out of their system in hopes that the wins return when it matters most. I bet that&rsquo;s what Lannie is telling himself, anyway.

<br><br>	<div class="game-header">Millennium Falcons 75.8&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Team Odouls 89.4</div>	Another meaningless game that impressed no one and produced nothing of note for this article, other than the fact that DeMarco Murray&rsquo;s spinach-infused hormones might be wearing off at the worst possible time.

<br><br>	<div class="game-header">The Bad News Bensons 99.5&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lawrence Football Jesus 45.9</div>	Oh, poor Jesus. At some point, James needs to transform his franchise from <a href="http://southparkstudios-intl.mtvnimages.com/shared/sps/images/shows/southpark/vertical_video/import/season_01/sp_0108_15_v6.jpg?width=480" target="_blank">this</a> into <a href="http://doctorbulldog.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/family-guy-jesus-pussycat-dolls.png" target="_blank">this</a>. In a win-and-you&rsquo;re-in game, Football Jesus put up 45.9. Wow. That&rsquo;s all I have to say.
