	The JADDL hasn't welcomed a new team into the league since 2009. That was the year the Millennium Falcons flew in from hyperspace and posted a 5-8 record, which made Ian the most successful first-year owner in league history.<br>
<br>
The Falcons began that year 1-4 after the first five weeks.<br>
<br>
In 2008, the one-year franchise Fifth Reich went 3-10, starting the season 2-3 after five games. A season before that, Mr. Intensity finished 2007 at 4-8-1 (a tie!), but not before kicking off their first and only season with seven straight losses. Hey, they finished strong, I guess.<br>
<br>
The point is, first-year owners don't just waltz into this league and crush it.<br>
<br>
That's why Make AmariCarr GR8 Again's start is so unexpected. If they closed out the year with a 2-7 stretch, they'd <em>still</em> boast the best inaugural season in the JADDL era. (I don't know how you assholes did in your first years in the RBSA, because Nolan and/or ESPN lost all that precious data.)<br>
<br>
How is #MAGA doing it?<br>
<br>
Well, primarily, they're encountering little to no resistance. As I tweeted out earlier, the most anyone has scored against them so far is 74.2&hellip;which is, objectively, fucking pathetic. But before you write AmariCarr off completely because of the weak schedule to date, a word of caution: there is one team in JADDL lore which faced even <em>less</em> opposition through the first four weeks. That would be 2007 Team Odouls. And that team made it to 12-0 before anyone handed them a loss; and then they made it to the Jared Bowl before being handed a second loss, by the same team (respect, Red Hornets).<br>
<br>
So there's no guarantee the other teams in the West won't simply keep rolling over for New Guy Nathan, right up to Week 13. He'll have to contend with the East for three weeks during interdivision play, of course, and take his chances in the playoffs&mdash;in any case, a 4-0 start can carry you a long way. After that? Who knows.<br>
<br>
Besides, AmariCarr has been putting in the work regardless of their need&mdash;or lack thereof&mdash;to do so. They're currently the third highest scoring team in the league. So if they make it to interdivision play unscathed, you can officially fire up #13and0Watch.<br>
<br>
But still&hellip;that schedule, though&hellip;<br>
<br>
<div class="section-header">Raider in name only</div>
I find it ironic that while Make AmariCarr GR8 Again is doing so well, the two players the team is named after are, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/ynbqA7tS4eg?t=17s" target="_blank">struggling</a>. Carr scored just 5.1 (for an entire game) a week ago, and is now sidelined with an injury. Amari Cooper leads the NFL in drops, and has scored 4.8 points.<br>
<br>
&hellip;In his past three games.<br>
<br>
&hellip;<em>Combined.</em><br>
<br>
So "Make AmariCarr GR8 Again" is more than a JADDL franchise; it's a Raider Nation prayer.
