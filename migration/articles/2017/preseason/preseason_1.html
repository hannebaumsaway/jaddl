	You know that one magical year for your fantasy football franchise? The one you won&rsquo;t stop talking about at dinner parties, if dinner parties are the sort of thing you&rsquo;re into? We have have one season in particular that just gets rosier and more illusively beautiful as time goes by&mdash;like a unicorn, or Rob Lowe.<br>
<br>
	But was that season <em>really</em> that special, or does it just feel like it to you because your team sucks?<br>
<br>
	The conversation of &ldquo;best team ever&rdquo; came up at the East Draft HQ this past weekend, so I decided to examine the numbers to see, as objectively as possible, which seasons truly should be revered in JADDL lore as shining examples of the league&rsquo;s proud tradition and prestige.<br>
<br>
	The methodology was pretty simple, although I fully expect Dan to blow rational holes in it&mdash;and James to blow irrational holes in it&mdash;after some inspection. I threw teams&rsquo; regular season wins, regular season points, playoff finishes, and titles&mdash;both division and league&mdash; into the spreadsheet blender at weighted amounts, and waited for a delicious ranking smoothie to spin out. The weights for each metric are obviously the bit that I had to tweak somewhat subjectively, so feel free to chime in with your opinion on how much points matter compared to wins, or championships, or whatever. And I&rsquo;ll feel free to ignore you and just roll with this anyway.<br>
<br>
	With higher numbers meaning more importance, I assigned the following weights: wins &ndash; 6; points &ndash; 2; playoff finish &ndash; 5; league title &ndash; 2.15; division title &ndash; 0.85. Now, before you freak out about the weights for the banner-hanging accomplishments, keep in mind those are <em>in addition to</em> the value you get for your playoff finish. So, for example, if you made it to the Jared Bowl, you got a 3 for your finish (i.e. the third round), and if you then </em> won the Jared Bowl, you got another 1.5 tacked on. The formula looks like this:<br>
<br>
	SUM(10*(wins/13)*6,10*((points-400)/1100)*2,10*((finish+(league_champ*2.15)+(div_champ*0.85))/6*5)/12<br>
<br>
	Yeah. Just think about it this way: if you went 13-0, scored 1,500 points, won your division (which would obviously be the case if you went undefeated, dummy), and won the Jared Bowl, you&rsquo;d score a perfect 10 on this list.<br>
<br>
	I think.<br>
<br>
	Enough with the fucking math. Let&rsquo;s look at the results. Here are the top five seasons in JADDL history, my friends, starting with #5.<br>
<br>
	<div class="section-header">5. 2013 Mighty Boom (7.88)</div>
	This was the first year the mighty Mighty was able to break through and capture the Limo in the modern, post-Ragin&rsquo; Black Squirrels Association era. Boom reached the promised land on the backs of&mdash;wait for it&mdash;the Cleveland Browns; namely, Josh Gordon and Jordan Cameron. Fucking Boom, man. Boom&rsquo;s ranking on this list is held back by the lack of a division title (hello, Bad News Bensons) and just a 9-4 record in the regular season.<br>
<br>
	<div class="section-header">4. 2007 Team Odouls (7.92)</div>
	I can already hear Peter complaining that a team which didn&rsquo;t even win the league is on this list above his 2013 squad. Well, too bad. The &rsquo;07 Near-beers are the only team in league history to win 12 games in the regular season. They also won a &ldquo;division&rdquo; title, which back then was probably more impressive, as you had to finish atop the <em>entire</em> league. Though they didn&rsquo;t win the Jared Bowl&mdash;which goes without saying, since we&rsquo;re talking about Team Odouls here&mdash;they did at least <em>get</em> to it. This team holds the bittersweet distinction of being easily the best team in history which didn&rsquo;t win the championship. If you recall, they went 12-0 before losing the last game of the season, and then lost the last game of the postseason for an encore. They&rsquo;re the 2003 Oklahoma Sooners of the JADDL.<br>
<br>
	<div class="section-header">3. 2015 Mighty Boom (8.10)</div>
	See, Pete? Here you are again. Chill out. 2015 Boom is essentially 2013 Boom with a division title added to the mix. Another 9-4 squad Peter rode to glory and faux immortality. This team actually scored fewer points than the 2013 version&mdash;236 fewer&mdash;but there was no Bad News standing in its way in the East, so there you go. A Russell-Wilson-and-Julio-Jones cocktail provided all the points Boom would need en route to the largest ass-beating in Jared Bowl history: a 44-point victory over the Tulsa Angry &ldquo;But do they really belong in this game though?&rdquo; Monkeys.<br>
<br>
	<div class="section-header">2. 2011 One Pump Chumps (8.81)</div>
	Jesse, may he rest in peace, took a lot of crap for the way he drafted and the players he coveted. He built his franchise on the backs of quarterbacks and D/STs, which, uh, isn&rsquo;t the way most people do it. So it&rsquo;s always surprising to me when I look back at numbers like this. The Chumps/Comfort are one of only four franchises with multiple 10-win seasons (the other three are Boom, Odouls, and the Bensons, so yeah, good company to keep). Yes, the Chumps were blessed in 2011 when Cam Newton fell into their laps due to our antiquated waiver wire system back then, and the fact that the Chumps were the worst team in Week 1 of that season. They scored 72 points that weekend. In his first game in a Chumps uniform, Cammy Cam scored 32 by himself. But whatever the reasons, the Chumps won 10 games, won the West, won the Jared Bowl, and don&rsquo;t have to apologize to a damn one of you for it.<br>
<br>
	<div class="section-header">1. 2016 Bad News Bensons (9.11)</div>
	Just as we suspected at the East HQ, this fresh list has a fresh face adorning its top. The moral of the story is, if you win your division and win the league as well, you&rsquo;re gonna have a good time. And that&rsquo;s just what the Bensons did last year. They also racked up 11 wins in the process, only the sixth roster to do so. Along the way, for good measure, BNB scored 1,371 points&mdash;the 11th highest single season total of all time. They could have gone undefeated had they not had to play Boom (twice). But my guess is Alex will be just fine chasing the perfect record another year, and settling for the Limousine, the Eastern Goblet, fame, fortune, a house full of women (ha, but literally though), and the distinction of topping this list for the foreseeable future.<br>
<br>
	So congratulations, Alex. Your 2016 team is unequivocally the greatest JADDL team of all time. OF ALL TIME.<br>

<br>
	<em>Oh, and in case you were curious: yes, that 2007 Football Jesus squad was the worst we&rsquo;ve ever seen. It&rsquo;s tough to beat one win and 768 total points.</em><br>
	<br>
	<strong>UPDATE:</strong><br>
	<br>
	I thought you all might be curious where your best teams rank, if they aren&rsquo;t in the top five above (and you&rsquo;re too lazy to peruse the spreadsheet). So here you go.<br>
	<br>
	7. 2009 Hauloll (7.51)<br>
	8. 2007 Hornets (7.51)<br>
	9. 2010 IPP (7.40)<br>
	10. 2014 Monkeys (7.35)<br>
	11. 2012 Falcons (7.32)<br>
	13. 2008 Longshanks (7.13)<br>
	20. 2012 Lanniesters (6.66)<br>
