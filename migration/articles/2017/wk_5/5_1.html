	The Angry Monkeys looked pretty shitty in the first two weeks of the season. They went 0-2, and scored 124.4 points&hellip;combined. Jacob started Eddie Lacy in Week 1&mdash;he scored 0.3 points. So Jacob replaced Lacy with Charles Sims&mdash;who scored -1.1. Jacob actually got negative points on the whole from his entire running back corps that week, as Jordan Howard could only muster 0.7 on his own.<br>
<br>
	Yes, things looked bleak for the 2014 champs.<br>
<br>
	But the rumors of their death appear to have been greatly exaggerated.<br>
<br>
	That running back corps has rebounded in a big, big way; scoring 51.4, 29.9, and 23.9 points in the last three weeks, respectively. And that number from this past weekend doesn't count the 25.2 RB Jerick McKinnon&mdash;the guy Jacob spent 42% of his entire free agent budget on&mdash;racked up out of the Flex spot.<br>
<br>
	Cammy Cam Juice has joined in the fun as well. He's averaging 30 points per game in his last two.<br>
<br>
	This resurgence has put the Monkeys back in business&mdash;Monkey business!&mdash;in the West, second in both standings and points.<br>
<br>
	The road certainly doesn't get any easier for them as they cross over to interdivision play, however. They drew all three teams at the top of the East&mdash;Jesus, the Bensons, and the Longshanks&mdash;so if they emerge in good shape after Week 8, look for the Monkeys to make serious noise for Jared's Goblet in the West, and perhaps even a postseason frenzy.<br>
<br>
	Or they could go 0-3 and crumble in the wake of Make AmariCarr GR8 Again's relentless march toward expansion franchise history.<br>
<br>
	That's why we watch these guys play the games while we follow their stats live on a computer or phone or tablet or smartwatch or VR headset, people.<br>

	Luke Skywalker knew what he was talking about when he said that about the Millennium Falcon a long time ago (in a galaxy far, far away&hellip;). Another week, another loss for Ian's crew, as they fall to 0-5 heading into the midseason classic.<br>
<br>
	In doing so, they became just the eighth team in league history to make it five weeks out of the starting blocks with five losses to show for it. How long do the Falcons want to keep this going? Are they shooting for history? Six teams have started 0-6; four teams have started 0-7; and only one team has started 0-8. No one has ever made it to 0-9.<br>
<br>
	It's lonely at the <s>top</s> bottom.<br>
<br>
	<div class="section-header">Wonder Twin powers: activate! Form of&hellip;dog shit</div>

	Speaking of the Falcons, they participated this past weekend in one of the worst JADDL games of all time. But it takes two to tango&mdash;off a cliff, in this case. The combined forces with Team Odouls to score just 107.4 points&hellip;total. That clocks their game in at eighth worst all-time.<br>
<br>
	Honestly, not as bad as I expected when I crunched the numbers.<br>
<br>
	The worst game ever? That would be the Week 7 clash in 2007 between The Mighty Boom and the Upset Underdogs, with a final score of 46&ndash;40, in Boom's favor. Boom and the Underdogs finished 3-9-1 and 2-11 that year, respectively, so the game kind of makes sense to serve as the JADDL's version of the Toilet Bowl.<br>
