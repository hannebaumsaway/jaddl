	Not long ago, In Pursuit of Perfection was 1-3. They were averaging 76 points a game and scaring absolutely no one.<br>
<br>
	Todd Haley would be proud, however, as in the last couple weeks, IPP has "forced their arrow up" and rattled off two straight wins, averaging 102 points per game in the process. Now they're back to .500, and the season is reset anew.<br>
<br>
	Antonio Brown is doing his thing as the #1 WR in the league; scoring touchdowns, racking up yards, live-streaming his life on Facebook, throwing hilariously over-the-top hissy fits on the sidelines, all that good stuff. No one is surprised by his production so far.<br>
<br>
	But what <em>may</em> surprise you is who the <em>other</em> guy is who's ranked #1 in his position on IPP's roster. That would be Deshaun Watson. Yes, it seems someone finally hit the rookie lottery in the JADDL, and that someone would be Nomac. With 117% of the Texans' defensive players injured (#fakenews), Houston is finding themselves in shootouts week after week, and Watson has risen to the challenge so far--scoring points in bunches for Pursuit, in the process. He's averaging 31 points per game over the last three weeks.<br>
<br>
	That's pretty good, y'all.<br>
<br>
	IPP is a flawed team--that running back situation...gross--as most .500 teams are. But they aren't nearly as flawed as they looked a few weeks ago. And that's all you can ask for in life, isn't it?<br>
<br>
	Unless you're New Guy Nathan, apparently.<br>
<br>
	<div class="section-header">The real pursuit of perfection</div>Because he's still undefeated and unchallenged entirely. It took his first East Division opponent to finally break 90 against him, for fuck's sake. (#MAGA still won that game by 31.2.) AmariCarr isn't taken that weak ass competition for granted, though. He's gone ahead and surged into the points lead league-wide, just to be sure. As a result, no one has gotten closer than 22 points away from the New Blood since the first week of the season.<br>
<br>
	Just a reminder: only four other teams in JADDL history have reached 6-0.
