	The Longshanks have been a long-running joke in the JADDL since their glory days of the mid-2000s. There was The Curse, sure, but far beyond that has been a common thread of gross incompetence. Trades that were anything but win-win. A first round draft pick that averaged 4.3 points per game through the first seven weeks of a season (LaDainian Tomlinson's zombified corpse, 2009). Drafting a tight end who was contemplating early retirement due to head trauma.<br>
<br>
	Et cetera.<br>
<br>
	So it's hard in this day and age to imagine the 'Shanks as anything but the loveable losers faithfully bringing up the rear in the East Division year after year. After year after year after year. In the divisions era, in fact, they've finished last five times in seven years. They're KU football, you guys&mdash;right down to the fact that their last good year, a league title in 2008, corresponds with the Jayhawks' last good year, which culminated in an Orange Bowl victory.<br>
<br>
	But maybe the Longshanks' rebuild is outpacing KU's. While the hapless Hawks have been losing to the likes of Central Michigan, Ohio, and likely everyone else they'll face this year, the 'Shanks have marched out to two victories in the first three weeks of the season. Small sample size? Sure. But they haven't started 2-1 in eight years, so it's still <em>kind of</em> a big deal&mdash;keeping the winning up will be a much grander occasion, of course.<br>
<br>
	They only need one more win to match their season total from each of the past two years, hilariously. And judging by the fact that they've been the second highest scoring team in the league thus far&mdash;by a large margin&mdash;chances are good they'll do at least that, and perhaps exceed the wins they've gathered in the past two seasons combined. That's only six wins, obviously, so don't get too awestruck by that statement.<br>

	AmariCarr is #MAGA'ing all over his new home in the JADDL West, and his foes seem rather uninterested in resisting it. Maybe they just want New Guy Nathan to feel welcome&mdash;because they're sure as hell rolling out the welcome mat for him each week. As a matter of fact, no team in the history of the league has faced <em>less</em> opposition through three weeks than what AmariCarr has seen this year. The previous three-week low for points against was set by the One Pump Chumps' opponents way back in 2010, with 189.9 points. AmariCarr's 2017 matchups&mdash;with the Red Hornets, Angry Monkeys, and IPP&mdash;yielded just 183.5 points. That's 61.2 points per game, for those of you keeping track.<br>
<br>
	So AmariCarr has basically gotten to play against the '07 Football Jesus squad (59.1 PPG) every week. Way to show the new blood how prestigious the JADDL is, boys. Good work.<br>
<br>
	<div class="section-header">Harvey poo face</div>

	Team Odouls is having the worst start to a season in the franchise's fairly illustrious history. They've started 0-3 before, but never with this low of a point total. The euphoria of Zeke Elliott becoming immediately eligible was quickly replaced by the reality that he's been worse than Mike Gillislee to date. Kirk Cousins needed a 28.8-point performance this past week just to crack the top 12 quarterbacks (it got him all the way up to 11th; i.e. the second worst starting QB in the league, theoretically).<br>
<br>
	But come on. How easy do you think it is to draft a championship caliber team literally in the middle of a hurricane? I think Adam deserves a little slack for his stuttering start to the year, don't you?
