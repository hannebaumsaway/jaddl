	It&rsquo;s only fitting that we should kick off the year admiring the defending champs, who&mdash;as we discovered a couple weeks ago&mdash;had the single greatest season in JADDL history last year.<br>
<br>
The Bad News Bensons kicked off their title defense with the most impressive win of Week 1 &hellip; not that that was much of a horse race. In fact, every other game was pretty shitty, to be honest. More on that later.<br>
<br>
First, we get to figuratively jerk Bad News off a bit. Let&rsquo;s start with Kareem Hunt (duh). Spencer Ware is about to get Drew Bledsoe&rsquo;d by this little guy, who isn&rsquo;t about to relinquish his starting spot when Ware returns. Hunt shredded the Patriots&mdash;and, thus, the Longshanks&mdash;all night long; on the ground, through the air, and would have done so on the sea, probably, if that were an option.<br>
<br>
And to think, Ryan smirked just a bit when Hunt&rsquo;s career began with a fucking fumble.<br>
<br>
Let&rsquo;s give Alex credit for the pick, as well. Sure, the Ware injury cleared things up regarding Hunt&rsquo;s viability; but still, as late as two days after the draft, Hunt&rsquo;s ADP was 63. Benson took him at 44. It&rsquo;s not likely he&rsquo;ll regret that &ldquo;reach&rdquo; any time soon.<br>
<br>
The other interesting thing to note about how Alex&rsquo;s draft paid off in Week 1? His draft day trade for&mdash;yep&mdash;Matt Bryant. The Atlanta kicker rewarded him with 12 points; a solid night that proved absolutely vital in holding off a late Longshanks charge.<br>
<br>
And a convenient marker to show the contrast between how the game went for the Bensons and â€˜Shanks.<br>
<br>
Because the Longshanks&rsquo; kicker absolutely fucked them over. Brandon McManus didn&rsquo;t miss a single kick all preseason. So when the Broncos suffered two negative plays to push them back to what amounted to <em>exactly</em> a 50-yard field goal&mdash;a veritable chip shot in Denver&mdash;Ryan began to think his luck had finally changed. A 50-yarder would give him six points &hellip; and a one-point victory. It&rsquo;d be so poetic. So glorious.<br>
<br>
Until it wasn&rsquo;t, because &ldquo;I can hit from 75 yards in a game!&rdquo; McManus tripped over his dick and pushed the kick wide right, ending the Longshanks&rsquo; comeback bid and renewing Ryan&rsquo;s feeling of hopeless inevitability regarding his moribund franchise. That feeling probably has to do with the fact that the Longshanks were one of only two teams to even score in triple digits this week &hellip; and his opponent just so happened to be the other one.<br>
<br>
Bensons, 123.3. Longshanks, 118.4<br>

Speaking of shitty weeks, you guys sure had one. The 978 combined points put up by the league this week marks the third lowest output since 2008. This was just the fifth week (out of 131) all time in which 10 or more teams failed to even get to 90 points. Furthermore, the league had the second lowest average score per game since 2008.<br>
<br>
Step it up, fellas. That&rsquo;s not how you want to start your 2017 campaigns&mdash;unless you&rsquo;re Alex. Or one of the other five owners who got Ws.<br>
<br>
But still. Step it up. That was gross.<br>

The individual scoring from Week 1 makes for some pretty hilarious reading. Out of the JADDL&rsquo;s top 11 scorers, three of them were defenses; one of them was a kicker; and one of them was Alex Smith. Why did I go with the top 11 instead of the more conventional top 10? So I could include the kicker, dammit.
