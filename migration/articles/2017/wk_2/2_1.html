	Just one year after starting a season 4-0 for the first time in franchise history, Lawrence Football Jesus is back at it again with a 2-0 jump on 2017. The hero of the hour, in case you hadn&rsquo;t heard, is naturally an obscure quarterback about whom James was crowing on draft day.<br>
<br>
That would be Carson Wentz, or the &ldquo;Wentaissance&rdquo; as James calls him. Lame nickname? Perhaps. (I liked &ldquo;Wentzer is Coming&rdquo; better myself, personally.) But his play early on has been anything but.<br>
<br>
Wentz is currently the number two QB in the league behind Alex Smith (hahaha). In fact, let&rsquo;s take a quick moment to appreciate slash marvel at slash shake our heads at the quarterback rankings as they stand today:<br>
<ol>
	<li>Alex Smith</li>
	<li>The Wentaissance</li>
	<li>Trevor fucking Siemian</li>
</ol>
<!-- 1. Alex Smith<br>
2. The Wentzaissance<br>
3. Trevor fucking Siemian<br> -->
If you were able to, and you had bet on that trifecta in Vegas, they would have just handed you the entire casino as your payout. It won&rsquo;t last, of course, but it&rsquo;s fun to admire while it does.<br>
<br>
As for LFJ, it may surprise you to know that they&rsquo;ve won nine of their last 11 regular season games. This is a franchise, mind you, that didn&rsquo;t get its ninth <em>total</em> win until the 36th game of its existence! This latest run isn&rsquo;t some schedule-driven fluke, either; Jesus has the second most points&mdash;behind the Bensons, as you would imagine&mdash;in the league over those 11 games dating back to the middle of last season.<br>
<br>
More than Hauloll, more than Odouls, more than the Lanniesters, and a lot more than the Mighty Boom.<br>
<br>
<div class="section-header">Boom: bust?</div>
Speaking of the Mighty Boom, owners in the JADDL have been conditioned to have a natural, organic fear of the Boomers, and rightfully so. They&rsquo;re the league&rsquo;s only three-time champ; and they lead the league in statistics such as wins, points, per-game average&mdash;you know, the little things.<br>
<br>
But if Pete has been the Tiger Woods of the JADDL, instilling terror just by his name showing up on the scoreboard, maybe he recently got caught with his nanny after careening his SUV into a fire hydrant. Because over the last 11 games we discussed above, no team has been <em>worse</em> than Boom. That&rsquo;s right: they have the fewest points of any team in the league (aside from AmariCarr, which is at just a slight disadvantage in this discussion) dating back to Week 7 of last year.<br>
<br>
Better hope Nike doesn&rsquo;t pull their sponsorship, Pete.<br>
<br>
<div class="section-header">West hurled</div>
(That&rsquo;s a pun on <em>Westworld</em> in case it wasn&rsquo;t clear.) I&rsquo;m looking at you, West Division owners, and I&rsquo;m looking at you in disgust.<br>
<br>
You have, collectively, scored 885.9 points through two weeks of the season. That&rsquo;s a new low in the divisions era, &ldquo;besting&rdquo; the 979.4 you, the West, put up in the first two weeks of 2010.<br>
<br>
We&rsquo;re talking about an average of 73.8 points a game, here, people. That&rsquo;s garbage. Are you guys garbage this year, or are you just slow starters? Mmmmm?<br>
<br>
<div class="section-header">We&rsquo;re going streaking!</div>
We know at least one team that&rsquo;s been dragging the West down lately. And by lately, I mean for over a year.<br>
<br>
The Tulsa Angry Monkeys lost 83.9&ndash;61.9 over the weekend to New Guy Nathan and his MAGA squad&mdash;the Monkeys&rsquo; 13th straight loss going back to last year. Yes, folks, that means Jacob has a shot at history next week. If he loses to Hauloll&mdash;who just happens to be the top scorer in the West, as underwhelming as that accomplishment is&mdash;the Monkeys will be the proud owners of the league&rsquo;s longest losing streak ever, at 14 games.<br>
<br>
The Longshanks HQ is planning a watch party for the Monkeys-Hauloll game.<br>
<br>
<div class="section-header">On your mark, get set, blow</div>
Team Odouls is 0-2. This isn&rsquo;t a first; they&rsquo;ve been 0-2 before. Several times. More times, in fact, than any other team in the league&mdash;five times, to be exact. No other team has started 0-2 more than three times.<br>
<br>
This is the same Odouls franchise, mind you, that once started a season 12-0.<br>
<br>
On a related side note, there is one team in the league which has <em>never</em> started a season 0-2. Can you guess which one it is?<br>
<br>
It&rsquo;s Boom, guys. That wasn&rsquo;t a trick question.
