    When 2-5 teams go up against 5-2 teams, you expect a blowout.
<br/>    <div class="news-quote">I don&rsquo;t want to be just another crappy Texas team. We have enough of those already.<div class="author">Adam</div></div>
<br/>    What you <i>don&rsquo;t</i> expect is for the 2-5 team to be the one doing the blowing out. <i>Blowing</i>, sure, but not blowing <i>out</i>.
<br/>    
<br/>    Well, that 2-5 team&mdash;Odouls&mdash;is now 3-5 thanks to disillusioning the Team Hauloll fanbase with a 101.8&ndash;59.2 beatdown. The ramifications of this game are potentially significant. A win would have propelled Hauloll to the top of the West all by its lonesome; as it is, they sit in a three-way quagmire with The IPA Connoisseur and the One Pump Chumps.
<br/>    
<br/>    In the East, things are clearer. The Mighty Boom is leaving bodies in its wake atop the division at 7-1 after six straight victories. New hotness Lawrence Football Jesus&mdash;equipped with RG<i>weeee!</i>&mdash;and the Millennium Falcons lag behind at 5-3. With this victory, Odouls is positioned as the best of the rest, easily within striking distance should the Falcons or Jesus falter down the stretch. And since divisional play begins again, and Odouls will get another shot at each Eastern foe&mdash;starting with the Falcons&mdash;a playoff spot isn&rsquo;t out of reach by any means.
<br/>    
<br/>    &ldquo;After 2009, we had more wins than any JADDL franchise,&rdquo; reflected Adam. &ldquo;Since then, we haven&rsquo;t even made the playoffs. I don&rsquo;t want to be just another crappy Texas team. We have enough of those already. I want to actually accomplish something, dammit.&rdquo;
<br/>    
<br/>    It&rsquo;s true, if you&rsquo;ll recall: Odouls was once the cream of the crop. Since 2009, though, they haven&rsquo;t spent a single week with a winning record. That&rsquo;s 34 straight weeks at .500 or below, for those counting.
<br/>    
<br/>    If you&rsquo;re an Odouls fan looking for signs of hope that a turnaround is imminent, don&rsquo;t look at the scoreboard. Though they put up 102 this past weekend, their last four weeks consisted of scores of 68.6, 77.9, 75.8, and 74.9. Yuck. Odouls&rsquo; overall resume is good for 10th in the current <a href="news/2012/wk_8/index.php?view=standings&amp;which=power" target="_blank">Power Rankings</a>, and that&rsquo;s only because the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks and Bad News Bensons suck so hard.
<br/>    
<br/>    QB Matthew Stafford&rsquo;s 33.2 helped Odouls get into triple digits in Week 8, but that was only the second time all year he&rsquo;s scored over 20. Denarius Moore added 15.6, but you can&rsquo;t play against the Chiefs every week, and he&rsquo;s scored under 15 in five of his other six games. The other major contributor for Odouls was the Giants D/ST, and we all know how reliable D/STs are (right, Lannie?).
<br/>    
<br/>    But hey, stranger things have happend than a team like Odouls making the postseason. In 2011, the 10th-place team in the Power Rankings after eight weeks was the Falcons, who ended up second in the East. In Week 8 of 2010, the Chumps occupied the #10 spot and also wound up in the playoffs when all was said and done.
<br/>    
<br/>    So as a matter of fact, in the Divisions Era of the JADDL, 100% of the teams who put up the 10th-most points through eight weeks made the playoffs.
<br/>    
<br/>    How&rsquo;s that for your fucking silver lining, Odouls fans?
