    Well, here we go. The <i>real</i> season begins this weekend.
<br/>    
<br/>    The 2012 regular season is over, clocking in as the third highest scoring year in JADDL play, by points per team. It saw dominance and clear favorites in the East and a clusterfuck in the West. So how will the postseason shake out?
<br/>    
<br/>    In the West, The IPA Connoisseur comes in as the obvious favorite to reach Jared Bowl VI after bringing home Jared&rsquo;s Goblet on the wings of a five-game winning streak to close out their schedule. All but one starter on IPA&rsquo;s roster is in the top 10 of their respective position rankings, led by Andrew Luck and Arian Foster. Luck&rsquo;s latest outing was a 30.9 burst that brought his average in IPA&rsquo;s last five games up to 21 points per.
<br/>    
<br/>    The Connoisseur, of course, will have to wait a week to see who they&rsquo;re going to play in the semifinals. Their opponent will be the winner of the Monkeys-Hauloll quarterfinal game.
<br/>    
<br/>    The Monkeys are the consensus pick to bow out of this dance before midnight, being the lowest scoring team in the playoffs. They&rsquo;re once again led by Aaron Rodgers, but Rodgers isn&rsquo;t quite the dominant force he was a year ago, when he had 339.5 total points at the end of the regular season (this year he put up 250).
<br/>    
<br/>    However, the Monkeys <i>did</i> sweep Team Hauloll earlier in the year, so there&rsquo;s that. Hauloll isn&rsquo;t exactly coming into the postseason from a position of strength, after a loss to the One Pump Chumps in which they limped to 61.8 points. Hauloll has Tom Brady&mdash;who outplayed Rodgers during the regular season&mdash;but they&rsquo;ll need Frank Gore and Andre Johnson to show up in a big way if they hope to make noise beyond this weekend.
<br/>    
<br/>    Over on the right side of the map, the bracket starts with the one and only Mighty Boom, the highest scoring franchise in the JADDL. Like The Connoisseur, Boom only has one starter that isn&rsquo;t in the top 10 at his respective position. Unlike The Connoisseur, Boom has at its service the D/ST of the Chicago Bears&mdash;likely the highest scoring D/ST in JADDL history (ESPN&rsquo;s past stats are hazy on this topic)&mdash;which Boom acquired, as we all know, after IPA dropped them. Irony&hellip;delicious. Peter wasn&rsquo;t satisfied with diamond-in-the-rough Doug Martin, so he went out and picked up newer-diamond-in-the-rough Bryce Brown, showing his EMAW colors along with his fantasy football savvy.
<br/>    
<br/>    Vying for the &ldquo;privilege&rdquo; of facing Boom are The Lawrence Football Jesus and the Millennium Falcons.
<br/>    
<br/>    Back in early October, Jesus fans had an &ldquo;Oh shit, here we go again&rdquo; moment after dropping three of four and scoring under 70 in two of the losses. That was soon forgotten, however, with the continued rise of RG3. Jesus only dropped one more game the rest of the way behind RG3&rsquo;s march to the top of the player leaderboard and JADDL MVP award. His primary partner in crime is Megatron, the #2 WR in the league.
<br/>    
<br/>    The Falcons see Jesus&rsquo; Megatron and raise them an A.J. Green, the league&rsquo;s <i>#1</i> receiver. Despite the disappointment of Panthers fans, Cammy Cam hasn&rsquo;t had a bad year, clocking in as the #5 QB in the JADDL and starring in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aKYZFcmAmU">funniest NFL commercial of the year</a>.
<br/>    
<br/>    Anything can happen in the JADDL playoffs at the end of the day, so sit back, relax, and enjoy the show. Unless you&rsquo;re Nolan, Adam, Jesse, Alex, Dan, or Ryan. You guys go stand in the corner and think about everything you did wrong this year.
