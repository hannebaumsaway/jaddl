    The time of death for the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks dynasty probably came and went a couple years ago, but 2012 sealed it beyond a shadow of a doubt. And to confirm the passing, we&rsquo;re pushing a team feature to page 2 of the newsletter for the first time in newsletter history.
<br/>    
<br/>    A year ago, the &rsquo;Shanks went 3-9-1. That&rsquo;s not good. However, the real story was <i>how</i> they did so poorly. Namely: The Curse. It seemed that a supernatural funk had befallen the once proud franchise, causing them to lose in bizarre, improbable ways.
<br/>    
<br/>    The 2011 &rsquo;Shanks set a record for the most points ever scored by a team which didn&rsquo;t get a playoff bid. In JADDL history, only twice has a team been beaten multiple times in a single season by less than a point. In both instances, the victim was the &rsquo;Shanks.
<br/>    
<br/>    2012 was a different story entirely&mdash;well, <i>almost</i> entirely.
<br/>    
<br/>    The Curse-related piece first: the &rsquo;Shanks set a league record for most points scored against them, and by a considerable margin. The &rsquo;Shanks had 61 more points scored on them this year than any team in history. The median value for Points Against in JADDL play is 1,161.9&hellip;the &rsquo;Shanks had <i>1,410.8</i> dropped on them this season.

<br/>    So yes, the Longshanks weren&rsquo;t done any favors, yet again. But that&rsquo;s not the real story here. Not this time.
<br/>    
<br/>    This year, the Longshanks just flat-out sucked. It didn&rsquo;t matter what their opponents did. It didn&rsquo;t matter whether The Curse lingered above Prairie Village for another round. The &rsquo;Shanks scored the 13th least points in a season since the JADDL was formed, and nothing its opponents could do would have salvaged this train wreck of a season.
<br/>    
<br/>    &ldquo;I wanted to believe 2011 was just a bad nightmare from which I&rsquo;d wake up,&rdquo; said Ryan. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m starting to think the years before 2009 were just a dream instead.&rdquo;
<br/>    
<br/>    At any rate, it&rsquo;s getting harder and harder for Longshanks fans to recall what the playoffs are like, seeing as how their team of choice hasn&rsquo;t been there in four years.
<br/>    
<br/>    And at this point, the trend tells us things are only getting worse for this franchise as it loses its grasp on all fragments of its former glory.
