    The West Division: what a fun little clusterfuck it&rsquo;s turned out to be in 2012!
<br/>    
<br/>    Over half the teams in the West sit at 5-4, in what amounts, technically, to a tie for second place at the moment. We all know things will work themselves out as the teams continue playing one another to close out the season, however.
<br/>    
<br/>    The good news for the Tulsa Angry Monkeys: they&rsquo;re not the Red Hornets, whom they squeaked past 88.4&ndash;84.5 this past weekend, and who sit at 1-8 (0-6). The better news for the Monkeys: they currently straddle the top of the 5-4 pile with an advantage in division records (4-2).
<br/>    
<br/>    The bad news for Tulsa? They&rsquo;re <i>way</i> behind in points, so if the division records even out, the Monkeys are sunk.
<br/>    
<br/>    The complete list of teams which have scored less points than the Monkeys to date:
<br/>    <div class="news-quote">Except for the years from 2007 to 2010, we thrive under pressure.<div class="author">Jacob</div></div>
    <ul>
    	<li>Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks</li>
        <li>The Bad News Bensons</li>
    </ul>
    
<br/>    That&rsquo;s it. Everyone else has eclipsed the 771.3 mark the Monkeys have put up so far. But, hey, all the Monkeys have to do is keep winning any way they can, and the points will never enter into the equation. The margin for error does remain razor thin, but Jacob doesn&rsquo;t seem to think that&rsquo;s a problem.
<br/>    
<br/>    &ldquo;The edge is where we like to live. We were in a precarious position in third a year ago after Week 9, and finished the season 3-1 to clench a spot. Except for the years from 2007 to 2010, we thrive under pressure.&rdquo;
<br/>    
<br/>    To be fair, the 2012 Monkeys aren&rsquo;t the worst team, points-wise, to find itself in second place in its division following nine weeks of play. In 2010, the One Pump Chumps were in the same position after only scoring 719 points. The Chumps finished the year 1-3 that season, but it was enough to make the postseason&mdash;and then get blown out in the quarters by the eventual champion IPP.
<br/>    
<br/>    The Monkeys got solid performances from Aaron Rodgers (let&rsquo;s put the Discount Doublecheck puns to bed for now, shall we?) and Marshawn &ldquo;Skittles&rdquo; Lynch against the Hornets. That was a good thing, too, since Rodgers and Skittles are pretty much all the Monkeys have. No offense to BenJarvus Green-Ellis, Dwayne Bowe, Jason Witten, Wes Welker, Justin Tucker, Hakeem Nicks&hellip;
