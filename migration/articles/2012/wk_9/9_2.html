    In case you didn&rsquo;t notice&mdash;and if you didn&rsquo;t, <i><a href="http://twitter.com/1Angry_Monkey/status/265239713638658049" target="_blank">get on fucking Twitter</a></i>&mdash;The Mighty Boom beat the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks 188.9&ndash;93.1 this past weekend.
<br/>    
<br/>    188.9.
<br/>    
<br/>    That&rsquo;s not a typo. You know how you can tell? The number 180 is referenced in both the title of this article and the image above, that&rsquo;s how.
<br/>    
<br/>    As you probably guessed after reading the subtitle above, that mark is now the single-game high in JADDL history. By the time Sunday afternoon rolled around, it wasn&rsquo;t a question of whether or not Boom would set the record; the only question was by how much.
<br/>    
<br/>    The answer: 32.9 points. That&rsquo;s right: if the previous highwater mark in all of JADDL play would have gone up head to head against Boom this weekend, it would have gotten smoked; burned; beaten by more than the average margin of victory for actual JADDL matchups (24.3).
<br/>    
<br/>    188.9.
<br/>    
<br/>    How do we even comprehend that number? If the &rsquo;Shanks would have joined forces in the East with either the Bensons, Millennium Falcons, or Odouls this past weekend, Boom <i>still</i> would have beaten them&hellip;
<br/>    
<br/>    Longshanks + Bensons = 178.7
<br/>    Longshanks + Falcons = 186.1
<br/>    Longshanks + Odouls = 188.8 (what a game <i>that</i> would have been)
<br/>    
<br/>    Only a combination with Football Jesus (198.8) would have put Boom away, and not by much.
<br/>    
<br/>    Doug Martin was the primary catalyst for Boom on this historic occassion, exploding for 57.2 points. So let&rsquo;s put that individual tally in context: Doug Martin, by himself, would have beaten the Bensons and IPP in Week 2, the Monkeys in Week 3, and Jesus in Week 7.
<br/>    
<br/>    On the other side of the spectrum, Boom did this with <i>zero points</i> from its tight end, some guy named Kyle Rudolph. So Kyle Rudolph gets to go down in history as starting for the team that broke the 180 barrier without lifting a fucking finger. And with QB Matt Ryan scoring below his season average. A lucky TD and some garbage crossing routes could have gotten Boom to 200, but that&rsquo;s a threshold that will have to wait. For now.
<br/>    
<br/>    188.9.
<br/>    
<br/>    The average score in 2012 so far is 92.7. Had Boom put up 92.7, Week 9 in 2012 would have ranked a pedestrian 26th all time in terms of total points. With 188.9, it ranks sixth. 188.9 is more than a whole extra team added to the scoreboard with league-average output. Think about that&hellip; take the league average, <i>double</i> it, and you&rsquo;d still only be at 185.4.
<br/>    
<br/>    Here&rsquo;s another fun fact: no two scores from the Upset Underdogs&rsquo; 2007 campaign can be combined to match or exceed 188.9.
<br/>    
<br/>    As a friendly reminder, I <a href="http://jaddl.clanteam.com/index.php?view=news&yr=2012&wk=1&pg=3" target="_blank">posed the following question</a> back after Week 1: &ldquo;Are any of you owners out there just a wee bit worried that&hellip;The Mighty Boom is going for total domination this year?&rdquo; If you weren&rsquo;t worried back then, you fucking should have been.
<br/>    
<br/>    188.9.
<br/>    
<br/>    Quite simply: holy shit.
