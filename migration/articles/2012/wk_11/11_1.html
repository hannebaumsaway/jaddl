    Last week, yours truly painstakingly calculated all the various scenarios that had to take place for each respective team still in the playoff hunt&mdash;sorry Hornets and &rsquo;Shanks fans. None of the scenarios were more complicated than the ones that would pave a postseason path for the Bad News Bensons. The numbers were checked and double-checked, and every conceivable angle was explored. It took hours.
<br/>    <div class="news-quote">Fuck you Boom, fuck you Falcons&mdash;Odouls, you&rsquo;re cool&mdash;fuck you Jesus, I&rsquo;m out.<div class="author">Alex</div></div>
<br/>    What a waste.
<br/>    
<br/>    Now, a week later, the Bensons have exactly zero scenarios that will get them to the promised land. It wasn&rsquo;t for a lack of effort on their part, though. In fact, they were quite clutch this past weekend, needing a win and getting it handily in a 101.3&ndash;75.4 romp over fellow playoff hopeful Team Odouls.
<br/>    
<br/>    Drew Brees (who else?) led the way for Bad News with 20.6 points, followed closely by the upstart Marcel Reece with 19.3. Randall Cobb continued to establish himself as the highlight of Alex&rsquo;s draft class with 15.3; he&rsquo;s now scored over 13 in five games after not being expected to do jack shit.
<br/>    
<br/>    Despite the win, it was a silent night in Overland Park Monday night. The Bensons, as you know if you read last week&rsquo;s feature, did not control their own destiny&mdash;they needed either the Millennium Falcons or Lawrence Football Jesus to lose out while they won out. We already know neither will happen, as both the Falcons (116.5&ndash;62.6 over The Mighty Boom) and Jesus (120&ndash;64.9 over the &rsquo;Shanks) won as well, effectively putting an end to the Bensons&rsquo; postseason dreams.
<br/>    
<br/>    With the knowledge of his impending demise in hand before Sunday night&rsquo;s action was over, Alex was as irate as any winning GM could be.
<br/>    
<br/>    &ldquo;Fuck you Boom, fuck you Falcons&mdash;Odouls, you&rsquo;re cool&mdash;fuck you Jesus, I&rsquo;m out,&rdquo; Alex seethed before storming out of his postgame press conference without fielding questions.
<br/>    
<br/>    You <i>are</i> out, Alex. Better luck next year.
<br/>    
<br/>    This also means the Eastern Goblet will have a new home this year; Boom is in the driver&rsquo;s seat for it, of course, but Jesus and the Falcons still have a shot at it should Boom drop another game.
<br/>    
<br/>    In other words, Alex went out and had that trophy made just so he could have the pleasure of shipping it to a division rival.
<br/>    
<br/>    As they say: timing is everything. And times, they are a-changin&rsquo; in the East Division.
