    In the first four years of the JADDL&rsquo;s existence, The IPA Connoisseur&mdash;then known as Mr. Mclovin, followed by The IPA Guzzler&mdash;won 16 games.
<br/>    
<br/>    Total.
<br/>    
<br/>    Of the eleven teams that have been around through the entirety of JADDL play, only Lawrence Football Jesus had less wins (14) over the same time span, and we all know how&hellip;checkered&hellip;Jesus&rsquo; fantasy football history is.
<br/>    
<br/>    Since then, something has started to happen. The Connoisseur started to put up respectable points, and they started to win.
<br/>    
<br/>    In 2011, following their second 3-10 campaign in three years, IPA started the season 7-2 and led the league-wide points race through Week 12. They couldn&rsquo;t quite close the deal though, losing the points race and West Division title to the One Pump Chumps in the final stretch.
<br/>    
<br/>    What started out as surprising elation for Connoisseur fans ended in surprising dismay, as IPA followed up losing its grasp on the regular season trophies by bowing out of the playoffs in the quarterfinals with a loss to the Tulsa Angry Monkeys. A season so full of promise for a fan base that had waited so patiently, and Lannie ended up bringing nothing home for them in the end.
<br/>    
<br/>    Many pundits thought the crushing end to the 2011 season would result in a hangover of sorts for 2012.
<br/>    
<br/>    Those thoughts were erased quickly as The Connoisseur ran through the first leg of its divisional schedule like a buzzsaw, going 5-0 and only winning a game by less than 13 once, with an average margin of victory of 24.2 points.
<br/>    
<br/>    Utter domination.
<br/>    
<br/>    Then interdivisional play struck. After averaging 110 points per game through its first five, IPA&rsquo;s scoring dropped to a measley 77.5 PPG against East foes in an 0-3 stretch that allowed Team Hauloll and the One Pump Chumps to catch up in the standings, as well as dropping IPA out of the points lead.
<br/>    
<br/>    D&eacute;j&agrave; vu, right?
<br/>    
<br/>    Not quite.
<br/>    
<br/>    Now that divisional play is back, IPA is back to its dominating ways, going 3-0 and winning by no less than 17 and averaging 98.7 PPG. Its 93.2&ndash;76.0 victory over the Monkeys this past weekend secured The Connoisseur&rsquo;s first Jared&rsquo;s Goblet. Lannie did not downplay the accomplishment&rsquo;s significance.
<br/>    
<br/>    &ldquo;It means a lot to our fans, to our community, and&hellip;hell, I&rsquo;ll say it: to me. Bragging rights, bitches!&rdquo;
<br/>    
<br/>    So it took four years for Lannie to win his first 16 games. It took less than two for him to win his next 16. No team in the JADDL has won more games over the same stretch starting in 2011, and only OPC has score more points.
<br/>    
<br/>    In the immortal words of Todd Haley, IPA&rsquo;s arrow is pointed firmly upward at the moment.
