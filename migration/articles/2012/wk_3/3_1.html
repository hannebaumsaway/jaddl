    The Lawrence Football Jesus is often mocked in JADDL circles. Other times, it's patronized. It's highly unusual for Jesus to be feared or respected.
<br/>    <div class="news-quote">This year I said, &ldquo;Fuck you Berry, I'll do it myself.&rdquo;<div class="author">James</div></div>
<br/>    Unusual, but clearly possible.
<br/>    
<br/>    The Jesus went for an image overhaul this offseason, requesting a new uniform, bolder colors, and an edgier logo, in an attempt to revitalize this once-dead franchise. Coming off a year in which disappointment soared to new levels after drawing the number one overall pick and riding it absolutely nowhere, Jesus owner James took a completely different path this time around.
<br/>    
<br/>    &ldquo;Matthew Berry is a douche, and I finally realized he's a douche. So this year I said, &lsquo;Fuck you Berry, I'll do it myself,&rsquo;&rdquo; said James of his 2012 draft approach.
<br/>    
<br/>    That approach included a radically bold move: drafting <i>both</i> rookie QB sensations Andrew &ldquo;#Suck4&rdquo; Luck and RG3. These were both meant for the bench, by the way&hellip;Jesus took Big Ben Roethlisbergerfergerwerger in the sixth round as his starting QB.
<br/>    
<br/>    Well, Big Ben only started the opening game; since then it's been RG3 leading the franchise recucitation, and leading it well. In Week 2 he put up 32.4 points in his career debut; this past weekend he overcame a dreadfully slow start to score 25.3, all of which was unnecessary in a 154.1&ndash;72.0 dismantling of the Fightin' Longshanks.
<br/>    
<br/>    That win registered as the third most points score in a regular season game and third largest margin of victory in JADDL history. For a franchise not accustomed to being on any side of an accolade but the wrong side, Jesus made a big goddamn statement this past weekend, James admitted.
<br/>    
<br/>    &ldquo;Last year was a crushing blow to our psyche, but it's always darkest before the dawn. And we're skipping dawn and going straight to bright-as-shit midday, motherfucker!&rdquo;
<br/>    
<br/>    In the aftermath of Week 3, Jesus finds itself atop the East at 3-0 with a nice headstart in points, at 347.1 total&mdash;The Mighty Boom is next in line at 2-1 with 310.3. As bizarre as it may sound (<a href="https://twitter.com/i/#!/search/realtime/%23BizarroJADDL" target="_blank">#BizarroJADDL</a>), a #13and0Watch might not be so farfetched. Jesus' lowest score in the first three weeks is 96.2&hellip;the league average to date is 90.4. If you take Jesus' own scores out of the equation, the league average falls to 88.1.
<br/>    
<br/>    Diving deeper, Jesus' prospects look to improve now that Peyton Hillis is sidelined or even slowed. This past weekend should spur an intense focus on getting Jamaal Charles the ball, which means more big games may be in order&mdash;especially considering the Chiefs' clear intent to minimize the number of chances Matt Cassel has to fuck up a game.
<br/>    
<br/>    Aside from Charles, Jesus has gotten 15+ points from five different players thus far, so you're never quite sure where the points are going to come from as an opponent&hellip;but you're pretty sure they're coming.
<br/>    
<br/>    Though Jesus has only had to play away from home once, that was this past game, when they marched into Prairie Village, stole the Longshanks' cookies, kicked its dog, threw its wet laundry on the floor, and left without shutting the front door. Suffice it to say, Jesus isn't intimidated in road environments.
<br/>    
<br/>    The next couple weeks will be extremely telling for The Football Jesus, as they travel back to KC to take on the third-place Millennium Falcons before coming back home to face their intra-city rivals, second-place Boom. Should Jesus make it to interdivisional play at 5-0, look out: the heavens are the limit for this gridiron deity.
