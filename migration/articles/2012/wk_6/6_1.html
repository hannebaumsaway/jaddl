    Six weeks in. Deep breath.
<br/>    
<br/>    Next week marks the halfway point of the 2012 season. Things are beginning to take shape&hellip;in the East, at least. In the West, it&rsquo;s a different story.
<br/>    
<br/>    Take In Pursuit of Perfection, LLC, for instance. A glance at the standings will tell you they currently sit in fifth place in their division. Ouch, right? But a longer look will tell you more; specifically, it&rsquo;ll tell you IPP is tied with two other teams&mdash;the Monkeys and the Chumps&mdash;at 3-3. They have more points than the Monkeys, and trail the Chumps by just 18.
<br/>    <div class="news-quote">[Like the Giants,] start slow, get off everyone&rsquo;s radar&hellip;sneak into the postseason, and let the improbable domination begin.<div class="author">Nolan</div></div>
<br/>    In other words, their current fifth place standing means absolutely nothing, and the West is totally up for grabs still.
<br/>    
<br/>    &ldquo;We have all our goals in front of us still,&rdquo; said Nolan. &ldquo;Well, we only really have one goal: make the playoffs. But that one is still in front of us.&rdquo;
<br/>    
<br/>    Should IPP do just that, they would double their quantity of JADDL playoff appearances in one fell swoop. Of course, they won the whole damn thing the first time they made the postseason, so that&rsquo;s a pretty good track record when they manage to keep playing beyond the regular season.
<br/>    
<br/>    This past weekend&rsquo;s 113.9&ndash;68.2 cruise past the bad, bad Bad News Bensons kept IPP in solid shape in the hotly contested West. IPP was led by Manning at the QB spot&mdash;<i>Peyton</i>, not Eli. Yes folks, that&rsquo;s right: Peyton Manning is relevant once again. Acquired in a trade with the aforementioned Bensons prior to Week 4&rsquo;s games, Manning acquitted himself quite well in a matchup with the team that drafted him, putting up 22 points in the victory. In the three weeks he was with the Bensons, Manning scored over 20 twice, but his other game was a putrid 7.5 outing. Since being traded, this was actually Manning&rsquo;s <i>worst</i> performance; he put up 25.3 and 24.3 in his other two games with the Purple & White.
<br/>    
<br/>    Not that it really mattered. Manning could have sat this one out and left IPP&rsquo;s QB slot vacant, and they still would have won by 23.7 over the Bad Team Bensons. Alex got double-digit outputs from three players this past weekend, and two of those were from a Flex WR and his kicker. The Bensons totaled 17 points from its QB (Rivers) and two RBs (Murray and Mendenhall, both of whom went down to injury). Those 17 points were outpaced individually by IPP&rsquo;s TE, Antonio &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not quite dead yet&rdquo; Gates.
<br/>    
<br/>    As for IPP, the trend is looking good. After scoring under 80 in its first two appearances, In Pursuit has eclipsed 90 in its last four, including passing 100 in two of its last three.
<br/>    
<br/>    &ldquo;We model ourselves after the New York Giants,&rdquo; Nolan admitted. &ldquo;Start slow, get off everyone&rsquo;s radar, watch the rumor mill spin about a coaching change, sneak into the postseason, and let the improbable domination begin.&rdquo;
<br/>    
<br/>    And the Giants are led by a Manning too. Intriguing.
<br/>    
<br/>    Maybe Alex should go out and see if Archie Manning still has some juice left in that cannon of his&hellip;
