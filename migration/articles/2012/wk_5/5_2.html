    The feeling is unanimous: divisions were a fantastic addition to an already fantastic league, making the JADDL even more, well, fantastic.
<br/>    
<br/>    Not only are they a breeding ground for intense rivalries and storylines to be formed among teams that see each other twice a year at minimum; they also enable a sort of mini-event to take place <i>within</i> the main event of the regular season as a whole:
<br/>    
<br/>    Interdivisional play.
<br/>    
<br/>    For three weeks out of every year, the script is flipped. Teams fly across the country to take on opponents they only see once every two regular seasons. Sometimes owners cheer on their codivisional compatriots in the name of divisional superiority and the bragging rights that come with it. Other times, owners hope teams from across the chasm can do them a favor and hand some losses to their division rivals, so their path to the playoffs becomes that much easier.
<br/>    
<br/>    In either case, tensions are heightened and the imaginary cleats are laced just a little bit tighter in weeks six through eight each year.
<br/>    
<br/>    It&rsquo;s always fun to look at the draws each team pulled on the ol&rsquo; JADDL schedule, to see who got shafted, who got a gift, and how that plays into potential playoff scenarios down the road.
<br/>    
<br/>    It looks like the West race could get a little murkier soon, as the IPA Connoisseur drew the short straw on interdivisional scheduling with the most difficult trio of opponents (points-wise) of any team in the league&mdash;the Falcons, Boom (game of the year?!), and Jesus. Those three have put up a combined 1,493.6 score to date. Second-place Hauloll has the fourth <i>easiest</i> interdivisional schedule with the &rsquo;Shanks, Jesus, and Odouls (1,357.6 combined).
<br/>    
<br/>    Lawrence Football Jesus is coming into interdivisional play on a two-game losing streak, and the schedule isn&rsquo;t doing them any favors; they&rsquo;ve got the second most difficult slate of games coming up against the Hornets, Hauloll, and IPA (1,471.3).
<br/>    
<br/>    Meanwhile, now would be a great time for the Bensons to make a move with its merry band of players who were drafted by other teams. Bad News is riding a two-game winning streak, and the interdivisional draw looks like <i>good</i> news for them: in IPP, the Hornets, and the Chumps, there isn&rsquo;t a single team among them with a winning record so far&mdash;and just 1,345 combined points (third least in the league, and the least of any Western trio).
<br/>    
<br/>    One more note of potential interest to someone west of the Rockies: though they&rsquo;ve probably dug too big a hole to make the postseason, don&rsquo;t be surprised if Mountain Time surges soon. They aren&rsquo;t as bad as their 0-5 record would have you believe. The Hornets have scored more than four other teams&mdash;including fellow Westerner, the Monkeys&mdash;and drew the second easiest interdivisional grouping in the league, with Jesus, the Bensons, and the &rsquo;Shanks on the docket (1,344.4).
<br/>    
<br/>    Bold prediction: the &rsquo;Nets don&rsquo;t go 0-13 this year.
<br/>    
<br/>    Bolder prediction: they don&rsquo;t have the worst record in the league this year.
<br/>    
<br/>    Bold<i>est</i> prediction: they finish ahead of the Monkeys in the West.
<br/>    
<br/>    At any rate, there are plenty of storylines to be had over the next few weeks, and we&rsquo;ll be here for you, uncovering them all.
