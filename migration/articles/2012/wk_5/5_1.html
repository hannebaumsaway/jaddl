    Since the birth of divisions back in 2010, no team has spent more time at the top of its respective division than The Mighty Boom&mdash;13 weeks. This surely comes as a shock to no one. The only surprise comes in the fact that Boom has yet to <i>finish</i> a regular season at the top of the East, an accomplishment the Bad News Bensons have monopolized to date.
<br/>    
<br/>    Well, here we sit again. The whole &ldquo;Bizarro JADDL&rdquo; thing was cute while it lasted, but The Mighty have reclaimed their special first place seat in the JADDL theatre, while The Lawrence Football Jesus has slipped back into a tie for second with the Millennium Falcons. This reclamation trend may be occurring in the West as well, as Team Hauloll has crept back into second place above the Tulsa Angry Monkeys.
<br/>    
<br/>    Back in Week 1, I asked the following question: <i>Are any of you owners out there just a wee bit worried that with the Torn Hoodie in hand and a Week 1 Briefly Badass, The Mighty Boom is going for total domination this year?</i> That was after Boom crushed defending East champ Bad News 124.2&ndash;96.7 to start the year.
<br/>    <div class="news-quote">I have no problem whatsoever with team defenses in fantasy football, as long as they&rsquo;re giving me 20 points a game.<div class="author">Peter</div></div>
<br/>    &hellip;Then Boom proceeded to score a shitty 75.8 in a 19-point loss to the Falcons. Other East owners breathed a little easier.
<br/>    
<br/>    They shouldn&rsquo;t have. Since that Week 2 clunker, The Mighty has averaged 108.4 points per game and a 25.5 margin of victory in three straight wins, including the latest: a 117.8&ndash;65.2 undressing of Jesus. Fear has been put back into the hearts of Boom&rsquo;s foes.
<br/>    
<br/>    This latest barrage in the Lawrence cross-town showdown was led, in the irony of all ironies, by a D/ST&hellip;the Bears&rsquo;, to be specific. The Superbowl Shuffle descendents put up 23 points for the Mighty Mighty Boomtones on Sunday. Peter is notoriously bad at managing D/STs (Boom got -8 and 1 from that slot in the two weeks prior to picking up the Bears), and thus has developed a reputation for bemoaning their role in fantasy football in general.
<br/>    
<br/>    That is, until now.
<br/>    
<br/>    &ldquo;I have no problem whatsoever with team defenses in fantasy football, as long as they&rsquo;re giving me 20 points a game,&rdquo; said Peter following his Week 5 tilt. &ldquo;If they&rsquo;re giving my opponents 20 points a game, I have a huge problem with them though.&rdquo;
<br/>    
<br/>    Now Boom comes to interdivisional play in a familiar position: as the East&rsquo;s standard bearer. Their interdivisional schedule is middling, in terms of difficulty as measured by total points scored by the opponents Boom is slated to play over the next three weeks (read more about that <a href="news/2012/wk_5/index.php?view=news&amp;yr=2012&amp;wk=5&amp;pg=2">here</a>), but it does include a potentially mind-blowing matchup with league braggart IPA Connoisseur in Week 7.
<br/>    
<br/>    After that, all that stands between The Mighty and its first&mdash;and, according to Boom fans, already overdue&mdash;Eastern Goblet is another stroll through its own division, which features a stale former flavor of the month in Jesus and its concussed RG-&ldquo;How many fingers am I holding up?&rdquo;-3; the Bensons&mdash;who are busy holding repeated everything-that-isn&rsquo;t-nailed-down-must-go! yard sales; oft-forgotten Odouls; and the cursed&mdash;and now downright shitty&mdash;Longshanks.
<br/>    
<br/>    The guessing game is best left to the Fifth Reich and Alex, but suffice it to say, I like Boom&rsquo;s chances.
