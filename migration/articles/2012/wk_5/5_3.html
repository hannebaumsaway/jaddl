	<div class="news-quote">If everyone is moving forward together, then success takes care of itself.<div class="author">Henry Ford</div></div>The Jared Allen&rsquo;s Designated Drivers Fantasy Football League, and its predecessor, the Ragin&rsquo; Black Squirrel Football Association, has been around for quite a while now.  While there have been some incremental changes made in the League&hellip;new commissioners, the advent of a League newsletter, some slight adjustments in scoring, basically the League is pretty much the same now as it has always been.  Henry Ford once said, &ldquo;If everyone is moving forward together, then success takes care of itself.&rdquo;  That is why now is the perfect time for to change, and by moving forward together, by embracing a new model, the JADDL will move into an unprecedented era of success.
<br/>
<br/>With Divisions, or Conferences, you don&rsquo;t just worry about how you&rsquo;re doing overall, but how you stack up against teams that you grow to appreciate intimately.  This is how it works in the NFL.  The Chiefs don&rsquo;t just worry about making sure they&rsquo;re in the top 12 of the overall NFL, they try to win their Division.  In the process, they have learned the joys of hating the fucking Raiders and the fucking Broncos, and of being indifferent about the Jaguars and Panthers.  This is exactly what would happen to the JADDL.  Familiarity breeds contempt, and contempt breeds good fantasy football. 
<br/>
<br/>Now there is potentially one problem that all of the naysayers are worried about.  What if one division is way better than the other?  OMFG!  Couldn&rsquo;t a potentially good team get screwed if it ended up in a stacked division?  Well, yes, but it&rsquo;s not as big a deal as the naysayers would make you believe.  First of all, there is a ton of random shit that cannot be predicted which will affect if a team makes the playoffs no matter what, so unfairness is built into the system already.  Also, it can be mitigated, as will be discussed later.  Finally, there is an upside:  for every good team that gets shoved out, a lesser quality team would get in!  One team&rsquo;s bitter fortune is the answer to another team&rsquo;s desperate prayer.  Anyone that&rsquo;s ever rooted for an underdog (see the 2006 Chiefs) must acknowledge and appreciate the spirit of this argument.
<br/>
<br/>So here&rsquo;s how a Division system could work.  We have 12 teams in our league, so logically we would split the league up into 2 6-team Divisions.  Each Division could each come up with their own name or something.  There are a number of ways to divide the League, so let&rsquo;s discuss:
<br/>
<br/>Geographically:  You could try to divide up teams based on where people live.  Maybe like all of the northeast Kansan teams, plus maybe a Manhattan team (I&rsquo;m not exactly sure where everyone lives), vs. everyone else (the so-called &ldquo;Southwest Division&rdquo;).   
<br/><div class="news-quote">By moving forward together, by embracing a new model, the JADDL will move into an unprecedented era of success.<div class="author">James</div></div>
<br/>Random:  Just a good old fashioned Division lottery.  The first six teams picked are in one Division, the rest in the other. 
<br/>
<br/>Equal Distribution:  Somehow try to create divisions with a mind for making them roughly on par with each other, talent wise based on the history of the League.  Thus, for every Red Hornets team, you can throw in a Third Reich, something like this.  Of course, this will lead to hurt feelings. 
<br/>
<br/>I&rsquo;m sure there are other intriguing ways, but I&rsquo;m just throwing these out for the sake of discussion. 
<br/>
<br/>Once you have the teams grouped into the two Divisions, that&rsquo;s when the fun begins.  In our format, there is a 13-game regular season, and 6 of the 12 teams make the playoffs, with the top 2 teams getting byes in the first round.  During the 13 game regular season with Divisions, each team would face-off against their Division rivals twice a year, and still get to play 3 non-conference teams in inter-league play. 
<br/>
<br/>Clearly, if there are 2 Divisions, the champion of each 6 team Divisions will get the bye in the playoffs.  How the remaining 4 teams are chosen for the playoffs, though, is negotiable.  You could have the top 3 teams from each division make the playoffs, like the NFL, or you could have the remaining 4 spots (other than Division Champs) selected at large from the entire league, kind of like the NBA Conferences come playoff time.  This later solution should mitigate fears that the Division system will just be rigged so the Football Jesus makes the playoffs, or whatever the worries are.    
<br/>What&rsquo;s really important is that we switch things up.  Consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds. As Jesse Jackson once said, &ldquo;At the end of the day we must go forward with hope and not backward by fear and dissention.&rdquo;  If it turns out Divisions sucks, we can always go back.  If they&rsquo;re awesome though, we would NEVER KNOW IF WE NEVER TRIED IT!
<br/>
<br/>It is my hope, as well as some other influential owners in the League, that this proposition get a fair shake.  I propose a vote be set up for the League to decide how to proceed, and that all owners have a chance to consider the option of Divisions before the vote.
