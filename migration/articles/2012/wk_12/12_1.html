    This is something we&rsquo;ve assumed for some time now, but it&rsquo;s all but official at this point.
<br/>    
<br/>    The 2012 Red Hornets are the greatest two-win team of all time. And, should they win next week, they have a shot to surpass the 2011 Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks as the greatest <i>three</i>-win team of all time (they would have to score 112 points in the victory to do so).
<br/>    
<br/>    There are two other two-win teams in the JADDL&rsquo;s history: the 2009 Return of Ron Mexico and 2007 Upset Underdogs. With a week still left to play, the 2012 Hornets have <i>already</i> eclipsed those teams&rsquo; total points for their respective seasons. Should the &rsquo;Shanks win next week&mdash;riiiiiight&mdash;they&rsquo;ll join the ranks of the two-time victors, of course, but seeing as how they&rsquo;re 134 points behind the Hornets currently, I think we can safely leave them out of the equation.
<br/>    
<br/>    Let&rsquo;s dig a little deeper into just how pissed Dan should be that his squad only has two wins to show for the 2012 campaign with a week to go.
<br/>    
<br/>    In JADDL history, 27 other teams&mdash;out of 75 total&mdash;had scored 1,092.5 points or more through Week 12. The average number of wins (through Week 12) for those 27 teams is 7.8. Only two other teams besides the 2012 Hornets had won less than five games to this point: 2010 Odouls and the aforementioned 2011 &rsquo;Shanks.
<br/>    
<br/>    It&rsquo;s easy to come up with a quick &rsquo;n&rsquo; dirty reason for what separates the 2012 Hornets from those 27 other teams: of them all, this year&rsquo;s Ginger Stingers have had the most points scored <i>against them</i> to this point: 1,221.4. That&rsquo;s 46.5 points more than the next guy in the order (once again, the 2011 Longshanks&hellip;are you noticing a pattern here?).
<br/>    <div class="news-quote">These cracks about &ldquo;Mountain Time&rdquo;&hellip;it leads me to believe the JADDL is awash in east coast bias.<div class="author">Dan</div></div>
<br/>    But we can go even deeper, and compare teams comparable to the 2012 Hornets points-wise (eliminating the upper crust teams).
<br/>    
<br/>    There are 25 teams aside from this year&rsquo;s Hornets that had scored within 50 points (+/-) of the Hornets&rsquo; 1,092.5 mark through Week 12. Of <i>those</i> 25 similar teams, the average wins to this point is still 6.2. Six wins after 12 weeks often keeps you in the hunt for a postseason berth. Hell, The Mighty Boom only had <i>five</i> through Week 12 a year ago, and they ended their season in the Jared Bowl.
<br/>    
<br/>    I just threw a lot of arbitrary numbers at you, but the point is that the 2012 Red Hornets have basically gotten screwed just as the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks had a year ago.
<br/>    
<br/>    Has #TheCurse moved on and landed on a new host?
<br/>    
<br/>    &ldquo;All these cracks about &lsquo;Mountain Time&rsquo; and whatnot, and it leads me to believe the JADDL is awash in east coast bias. The east cost in this case being the left bank of the Missouri River, of course,&rdquo; said Dan on the topic. &ldquo;Perhaps that bias has led to some&mdash;irregular&mdash;scoring patterns when teams face off against the league&rsquo;s westernmost franchises, who knows.&rdquo;
<br/>    
<br/>    What we <i>do know</i> is that the Hornets have scored in the 100s twice this year, and both times their opponent still managed to score more&hellip;most recently this past weekend when the Buzzers showed true grit and determination yet again in a 117.6&ndash;111.7 loss to Team Hauloll.
<br/>    
<br/>    With all this being said about how &ldquo;game&rdquo; the Hornets have been in defeat, and about how they&rsquo;ve basically been fucked six ways from Sunday by the fantasy football powers that be, let&rsquo;s ground Dan a bit and wrap the column up with some words from Vince Lombardi:
<br/>    
<br/>    &ldquo;You show me a good loser, and I&rsquo;ll show you a loser.&rdquo;
