    It&rsquo;s possible this could be a chicken-or-the-egg situation. It&rsquo;s possible the sample size still isn&rsquo;t large enough to draw any concrete conclusions.
<br/>    
<br/>    One thing is for certain, though: the 11th draft position is a <a href="news/2012/wk_12/index.php?view=league&amp;which=stats" target="_blank">statistical hellhole</a>.
<br/>    
<br/>    Let&rsquo;s examine the slots in terms of regular season wins their teams have produced over the years. The top dog? Pick #3, which has produced 49 wins to date. Go down the list and you get to the second worst slot, which happens to be Pick #12, with 31 wins.
<br/>    
<br/>    So, there are 18 wins separating first place and eleventh place. To get down to last place&mdash;Pick #11, of course&mdash;you have to keep going down <i>another 10 wins</i> (to 21 wins).
<br/>    
<br/>    Assuming the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks lose next week&mdash;meaning Pick #11 would still be at 21 wins&mdash;Pick #11 would average 3.5 wins per season if it were an actual team. Awesome.
<br/>    
<br/>    In terms of winning percentages, the second-to-last slot&mdash;still Pick #12&mdash;produces teams that win 41% of their games. Pick #11 clocks in at 29%. In more stark terms, teams who drafted 11th have <i>lost 70% of their games</i> (there were two ties in there as well).
<br/>    
<br/>    Here&rsquo;s where the picture gets a bit cloudier for Pick #11: points. Pick #11 has produced more points (during the regular season) than three other slots&mdash;#8, #12, and #10.
<br/>    
<br/>    How can this be? Pick #11 is so atrocious in terms of wins compared to the other slots, how on earth are they not dead last in points as well?
<br/>    
<br/>    This is where the &ldquo;unfortunate&rdquo; part of the article title comes in. Teams who drafted 11th have been scored <i>against</i> more than teams who drafted in any other position. Why? Who knows? Maybe Jared Allen hates the number 11. Again, maybe the sample size is too small yet.
<br/>    
<br/>    Or maybe it&rsquo;s a somewhat self-fulfilling prophecy due to the fact that, by chance, general managers who were going to have a shitty draft just happened to draw the #11 pick. Then, when they inevitably drafted shittily, Pick #11 was caught holding the bag, for lack of a better phrase. It doesn&rsquo;t help that poor Pick #11 drew the now dreadful Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks the past two years, years in which the &rsquo;Shanks rewarded Pick #11 with four total wins.
<br/>    
<br/>    Then again, maybe the &rsquo;Shanks are now dreadful <i>because</i> they got saddled with the 11th pick twice in a row&hellip;&rsquo;Round and &rsquo;round we go!
<br/>    
<br/>    Let&rsquo;s take one more shot at trying to address the chicken-or-egg proposition. Of the teams that have drafted 11th at one time or another&mdash;The Mighty Boom, Red Hornets, Lawrence Football Jesus, Team Odouls, and of course the &rsquo;Shanks&mdash;we&rsquo;ve established that they&rsquo;ve collectively gone 21-54-2 in the combined years when they actually drafted 11th. But how did those same teams do in the years when they <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> draft 11th?
<br/>    
<br/>    172-134-4. A .561 winning percentage, as opposed to the .286 average Pick #11 is batting to date. Interesting contrast, wouldn&rsquo;t you say?
<br/>    
<br/>    Oh, and in case you&rsquo;re wondering why I didn&rsquo;t produce any playoff stats for Pick #11, that&rsquo;s because there <i>aren&rsquo;t any</i>. That&rsquo;s right: no team which picked 11th has ever made the postseason. That includes the mighty Mighty Boom, remember.
<br/>    
<br/>    That&rsquo;s right: Boom once missed the playoffs. It was 2007, and they drafted 11th that year. They ended up going 3-9-1 and stayed home for the holidays.
<br/>    
<br/>    Since then? Boom has avoided Pick #11, and they&rsquo;ve gone 46-18 to this point, with a playoff spot already clinched for 2012.
<br/>    
<br/>    Yeah&hellip;whether it&rsquo;s the chicken or the egg, the cart or the horse, Pick #11 fucking sucks.
