	ESPN takes its shot at grading the JADDL Draft
</div>

<div id='article'>
	So you see, ESPN has provided me with a new &ldquo;Commissioner Toolkit.&rdquo; Part of this toolkit is a draft grading system, created with analysis and input from&hellip;
<br />    
<br />    &hellip;Matthew Berry.
<br />    
<br />    I thought that was so hilarious that the grades just <i>had</i> to be posted for all to see. And who knows: maybe Mr. Berry&rsquo;s grades will stand up better than Mr. Gutierrez&rsquo;s at year&rsquo;s end.
<br />    
<br />    But I doubt it. Enjoy:
