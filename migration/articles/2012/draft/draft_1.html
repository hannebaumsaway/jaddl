<br />    Can&rsquo;t go wrong with Ray Rice, although I do have a weird feeling this is going to be the year he has season ending injury&hellip;but what do I know? Just a fat gut feeling.  Love Julio down by the school yard and pretty nice double up/catch up with Matt Ryan.  I love your RBs.  Tons of depth and some sneaky guys that could have breakout years.  I worry a little bit about your TEs, but then again the Tight End position is a good problem to have if that is your only weakness, and you have 2 guys that have proven they can get it done if they are healthy and a young sleeper.  Very solid WRs; I think Torrey Smith and Titus Young are poised to have good years, especially Smith.  I am a fan of the Bills D/ST with the additions they made in the offseason.  Should see some sacks out of them.  Overall I think you could have the best team in the league.

<br />	Top to bottom I like this squad a lot.  Looked like some savvy drafting except for the lack of a back-up to the 36-year-old Peyton Manning.  Love the 1st round pick of Murray&mdash;I think he is going to have a stellar year.  Steven Jackson is not flashy but a pretty good pick considering who was available. I love your TEs.  I think you might be able to turn one of them around for a 2nd QB if need be.  I think Manning and Decker are going to hook up a lot.  Not high on Boldin but I think Britt will be a good pick and then I like the late fliers on Cobb and Robinson.  Getting Mendy that late and ending your draft with Hunter were both great moves; with M. Bush vulturing some of Forte&rsquo;s TDs, that&rsquo;s sold depth at RB.  Eagles D/ST is a top 3 or 4 and Sea Bass always seems to have big weeks when you need them.  Almost a really good grade; I just worry about the Health of Manning.

<br />	I don&rsquo;t like Romo but you can&rsquo;t argue with his numbers.  Dude had 31 TDs and only 10 INTs last year plus he threw for over 4k yards.  The guy just gets it done.  I think it was a good move to also get Dez, if he stops beating his mother.  I think Chris Johnson is due to have a solid season and thank goodness for you MJD is done holding out.  Now it looks like a brilliant pick to get him that late.  Love Jennings and I think Meachem could end up being Rivers&rsquo; go-to WR.  This could be Spiller&rsquo;s breakout year.  Pierre Thomas and Ridley are sold depth.  Rueben Randle will eventually beat out Hixon as the NYGs slot guy.  The only thing keeping you from an A is your TE spot&mdash;just not good.  Dickson has potential but Winslow is a bum. 
<br />

<br />	Got to love getting Brady&hellip;he&rsquo;s the best looking player in the league and his smoking hot wife is all the proof we need.  I do think Andre Johnson is a bit overrated (never has had a double digit TD season).  I like several WRs better that went after him like Julio Jones.  With that said I love your WRs.  I think your RBs are pretty mediocre.  I don&rsquo;t like Gore, I think they like Hunter and James quite a bit in San Fran so I think that might end up as a committee RB team.  Bradshaw is solid but lukewarm on K. Smith and any Wash. RB.  I think Bennett could be a sleeper at TE but wouldn&rsquo;t feel great that the other TE you have is a rookie.  Good late pick of Taiwan Jones because McFadden never stays healthy.  Love your back-up QB; could be valuable on the trade market later in the year.  It&rsquo;s never bad to have the Ravens D/ST.
<br />
<br />	<span class='draft-grade'>B</span> <span class='draft-team'>Team Odouls</span>
<br />	You have a top 5 QB and the best TE in the game.  That&rsquo;s a pretty solid foundation for your squad.  Larry Fitz keeps putting numbers up even with subpar QBs.   I worry a little about Mathews but loved him before his injury.  I called it last year when Reggie Bush had a breakout year.  I think that continues this year.  After Fitz your WRs even out but I think they are still pretty solid.  I think your depth at RB is nice.  I like Don Brown and think he will get most of the work in Indy and Tate is solid&hellip;he always finds a way to steal points from Foster.  I would look into getting rid of Goodson, he will probably end up as the 3rd RB in Oakland.  Just keep your eye on that situation.  Good 2nd TE; I like Pettigrew quite a bit and I think Randy Moss could be a great late pick.  It&rsquo;s never easy drafting at the 12 slot on a snake draft.

<br />	I like Brees but it&rsquo;s hard for me to like the Saints&rsquo; situation.  I think it would be impossible to lose the play caller and actually improve from the past few years.  I guess if there is a guy who can do it would be Brees.  I just think it&rsquo;s unlikely.  3 years ago you would have had the best RB tandem in the league&hellip;unfortunately for you it&rsquo;s 2012.  At least you handcuffed yourself by drafting Gerhart but your only other RB Vereen probably wont even be active the first few weeks so you have no depth and a handcuff.  Not a great place to be.  I do like Gates&mdash;it looks like he is finally healthy and your WR corps, although lacking a true #1, has some guys that could have big years.  I like Brown, Garcon, and the Moores.  Manningham could be a sneaky pick.  I think you would have been better off drafting Boss over Moeaki.  I like Gould; good get with your last pick.  I just can&rsquo;t give you a decent grade with those RBs.

<br />	Here we go&hellip;Cam Newton will take the biggest step back of any big time fantasy player from last year.  I mean the guy ran for 14 TDs; I bet he will have more like 4 or 5.  I think that is a big reason they got Tolbert in the off-season.  Panthers don&rsquo;t want him running that much and taking those hits.  He got off to a hot start last year but he didn&rsquo;t throw over 200 yards his last 3 games.  I do like your Gronk and AJ Green picks.  Green is a stud.  Hate Shonn Greene but think he might have a decent year.  Crabtree, Rice, and Baldwin have potential but Holmes has Dirty Sanchez and Tebow throwing to him.  Not sure who is going to be the guy between Williams and Stewart.  I like your back-up TE and your last pick was decent to cover your McGahee pick, but Brandon Jacobs?  Really?  I like Kendall Hunter a lot more than Jacobs.

<br />	No-brainier going with Rodgers. I would have taken him or McCoy at #1 overall.  I am not a Welker fan; he is getting long in the tooth.  He is in a contract year but with the emergence of the TEs in NE, I am not big on him this year.  I think you would have been better off with Victor Cruz.  I do think the Law Firm of BGE is going to have a good year so I like that pick, but with Lynch already in question you could be in some trouble with your 2 back-ups.  I like Ingram but I hate Felix.  Nicks is good if he is healthy.  Pretty solid WR core but with Lynch, Nicks and Witten all concerns I have to grade you down. 
<br />

<br />	I love McFadden and the 10 weeks he will give you.  If you draft him you have to get his back&hellip;whoops you failed to do that.  His backup went 5th to the last pick so you had plenty of chances to get Taiwan Jones.  Don&rsquo;t understand why you went Hillman instead of Jones.  This will cost you once McFadden goes down.  Forte is solid, but coming off an injury and with the addition of M. Bush I am not as high on him.  Vick is electric when healthy and I really like your Cutler pick because of that.  Vernon Davis is a stud and solid get in the 6th.  Beanie is a good 3rd RB but with his health often being in question Jennings and Hillman are just not good enough.  I like your WRs White is a legit #1 and Austin is solid.  I think Reggie is going to have a nice bounce back year now that he has a real QB.  This team should be called the Hurtin&rsquo; Longshanks.  Health could be a big problem with this roster.

<br />	You drafted in my opinion the best RB in the league so thumbs up there, although it was an obvious choice with Rodgers and the other big 2 RBs gone.  Not a huge Fred Jackson guy; I think this might be Spiller&rsquo;s breakout year and the tread on old Freddie&rsquo;s tires are getting worn.  I don&rsquo;t like Eli but I do like your back-up where you got him that late.  I have zero faith in the Jets&rsquo; QB so I think you dropped the ball only taking one TE.  Redman might be alright but as soon as Mendy is back I think he will get only a few touches.  Not big on any Saints WRs because Brees spreads the wealth so much.  I like V. Jack and think you got good value with your Maclin pick.  James Starks is trash but you made up for it by taking Alex Green.  I think Hankerson could pan out if RG3 has a good year.  You did get one of the top D/STs in the Texans.  Overall I think you could run into some issues at the RB position but not &rsquo;til the middle of the season.  The minus is for drafting T.O.
<br />
<br />	<span class='draft-grade'>D+</span> <span class='draft-team'>The IPA Connoisseur</span>
<br />	The safe play taking Foster with the #1 pick&hellip;unfortunately he is not my #1 RB.  I think Ben Tate will steal some goal line TDs and several touches.  That is why I like McCoy and Rice better.  I am also not a big Trent Richardson guy, especially with the injury questions. Decent get with Rivers in the 4th and I think Jared Cook to back up TG was a good move.  Love Cruz and I like Demaryius Thomas, he was a good WR to get at the back end of the 7th the only issue is I think I would have rather had Jeremy Maclin there.  He was taken 3 picks later.  Overall, a below average team because of your RB depth.  Benson is a decent 3rd RB but in a pass heavy offense.  I am not crazy about Tolbert and I think Pead has value only if S. Jack gets hurt.
<br />

<br />	You got the best WR in the league right about where he is suppose to go.  Good job on not screwing that one up.  I can&rsquo;t say I am very excited about your starting RBs.  Hillis is driving Jam-Chucks value down and any given Sunday 1 of the 3 RBs in New Orleans could be the guy.  You did do a solid job of adding depth in Stewart and Blount.  Thomas will only have value if Bush gets hurt which he very well could.  I don&rsquo;t like your back to back picks of QBs you should have taken the best WR possible instead of Big Ben or RG3.  I like RG3 better but Ben is proven (not just to be a rapist).  The potential with Luck and RG3 is sweet but your team will suffer at the WR position because of it.  You should be looking to trade whichever one has a hot start.  Your top 2 WRs are awesome your other 3 are trash.  You could have had a very good grade but I am penalizing you for taking too many QBs and for where you took them.  You have an underachieving TE who I like but can&rsquo;t ever live up to the hype. (This grade is pending an RG3 / Luck / Big Ben trade.)
