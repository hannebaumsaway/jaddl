    After winning no less than eight games in each of the JADDL&rsquo;s first four regular seasons, Team Hauloll has now done just that in the past two seasons.
<br/>    
<br/>    That anti-feat led to them missing the postseason for the first time in franchise history. This time?
<br/>    
<br/>    It has led them to the Jared Bowl.
<br/>    
<br/>    This is nothing new for Hauloll. They were here back in 2009, when they took home the Limousine with a 100.8&ndash;96.3 victory over the Red Hornets in Jared Bowl III.
<br/>    
<br/>    Winning in general is nothing new to Hauloll. They&rsquo;re tied with The Mighty Boom for the winningest franchise in the JADDL to date, and trail only Boom in all-time points.
<br/>    
<br/>    That being said, last weekend wasn&rsquo;t a testament to those lofty marks. Hauloll stumbled to just 82.4 points, but West Division champ IPA Connoisseur didn&rsquo;t just stumble&hellip;they fell flat on their face en route to 73.4 and are now crawling back home to watch the Jared Bowl on TV with the rest of us.
<br/>    
<br/>    Survive and advance, as they say, and thus the lackluster performance means nothing to Hauloll now. The fantasy football world is on the table for them this weekend, and all that stands in their way is the newest kid on the block, the Millennium Falcons.
<br/>    
<br/>    Leading the way for Hauloll will be Jared Bowl vet Tom &ldquo;Tommy&rdquo; Brady. Brady was at the helm for Boom in the 2011 title game, so he&rsquo;ll be as comfortable on the imaginary field this weekend as he is on the red carpet of a car commercial premiere.
<br/>    
<br/>    Brady is the second highest scoring player in these playoffs so far. That&rsquo;s great and all, except for one thing: the <i>top</i> scoring player in this postseason is leading the Falcons against Hauloll in the title game.
<br/>    
<br/>    Brady will likely get help from Frank Gore and Andre Johnson; whether it&rsquo;ll be <i>enough</i> help will probably depend on the various role players on the roster&hellip;and whether Ahmad Bradshaw will be healthy enough to play, and be productive.
