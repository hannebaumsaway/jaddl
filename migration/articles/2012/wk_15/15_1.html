    The Millennium Falcons have been established as the winningest expansion franchise in league history&mdash;across both the RBSA and JADDL&mdash;for some time now. Let&rsquo;s be honest: it wasn&rsquo;t much of a horse race. When you&rsquo;re in a beauty contest with The Fifth Reich, all you have to do is avoid tripping or picking your nose, and you&rsquo;re golden.
<br/>    
<br/>    But to date, the Falcons haven&rsquo;t won anything significant. They&rsquo;ve got a smattering of Briefly Badasses, but nothing else lining the trophy case.
<br/>    
<br/>    That&rsquo;s about to change.
<br/>    
<br/>    Following Jared Bowl VI this weekend, the Falcons will go home with the Surrendered Keys at the very least, the revered Court-Ordered Limousine being the ultimate goal.
<br/>    
<br/>    JADDL pundits have seen this coming. The Falcons are the very definition of progress; their successive regular season win totals could keep time in a dance studio&hellip;five, six, seven, eight. They missed the playoffs in their inaugural year, but haven&rsquo;t since.
<br/>    
<br/>    And now, they find themselves playing for the whole enchilada this weekend after a stunning upset over everyone&rsquo;s pick to win the title, The Mighty Boom. That pick was blown out the window along with Boom when the Falcons hung 133.5 on them.
<br/>    
<br/>    This comes a week after Millennium put up 120.8 on the Lawrence Football Jesus, which makes the Falcons everyone&rsquo;s <i>new</i> pick to win the Jared Bowl. The Falcons&rsquo; combined 254.3 points in the quarters and semis is the third highest such tally in JADDL history.
<br/>    
<br/>    That&rsquo;s the good news.
<br/>    
<br/>    The wet blanket on that stat is that Team Hauloll&mdash;the Falcons&rsquo; opponent this weekend&mdash;put up the fifth highest such tally in league history themselves, so they aren&rsquo;t exactly going to go quietly into the night.
<br/>    
<br/>    Hauloll also has the experience factor on their side: they&rsquo;ve been here before, and won, in 2009.
<br/>    
<br/>    But the Falcons aren&rsquo;t scared; they&rsquo;re New Money, and carry themselves with confidence and a chip on their shoulder accordingly. Cam Newton has been infused once again with Cammy Cam Juice, averaging 33 points in his last four games. DeAngelo Williams looks rejuvenated as well, putting up around 20 in both of the Falcons&rsquo; playoff games.
<br/>    
<br/>    Then there&rsquo;s practice squad hero Knowshon Moreno, who has taken a cue from Williams in reviving his career in this postseason.
<br/>    
<br/>    Can they keep it up for one more game? We shall see. Regardless, it doesn&rsquo;t look like the Falcons franchise is going away any time soon.
