    Welcome back to the JADDL spotlight, Cam Newton!
<br/>    
<br/>    The toast of the league a year ago after being snatched up off the waiver wire&mdash;well, you all know that story already&mdash;Newton had yet to really break out in 2012. A nice Week 2 (25.1 points) was bracketed by two pretty shitty weeks (12.4 and 10.2). Cammy Cam only scored that low or lower a single time <i>all</i> of last season. Through four weeks in 2011, Newton had nine touchdowns to five turnovers; this year he&rsquo;s got seven TDs and six TOs. Both metrics moved in the wrong direction if you&rsquo;re Ian Wolfe.
<br/>    
<br/>    Prior to this past weekend, Newton had four TDs to those six TOs. In case you can&rsquo;t handle the math, that means he put up three scores without any interceptions or fumbles. That&rsquo;s progress in the <i>right</i> direction, as Ian will tell you.
<br/>    
<br/>    &ldquo;Of course I still see a potential star in Cameron, or I wouldn&rsquo;t have drafted him in the first round, stupid.&rdquo;
<br/>    
<br/>    Easy, fella.
<br/>    
<br/>    Newton (31.2) didn&rsquo;t take care of the previously undefeated Lawrence Football Jesus by himself. He had plenty of help from&mdash;well, a lot of people, starting with the 49ers D/ST. The Niner Nasties posted a cool 28 points by shutting out the Jets while snagging eight turnovers, returning one of those for a touchdown, blocking a kick, and recording three sacks on the nutsack-less Mark Sanchez.
<br/>    
<br/>    Three other Falcons passed the 15-point mark as well, including kicker Matt Prater.

<br/>    The Jesus didn&rsquo;t know what hit it.
<br/>    
<br/>    &ldquo;[Our score] would have beaten every other East team this week,&rdquo; lamented James on The DDL earlier this week.
<br/>    
<br/>    Unfortunately for James, his squad was playing the Millennium Falcons, and his score was good enough only to somewhat lessen the blow in a 144.5&ndash;98.6 bludgeoning.
<br/>    
<br/>    The Falcons are now 3-1 alongside Jesus (yet still 49 points behind) and have a seemingly weak Team Odouls (1-3) to contend with before entering interdivisional play. Of course, Millennium&rsquo;s only loss to date was to the other 1-3 team in the East, the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks, so Ian would be wise to not look past Adam this weekend.
<br/>    
<br/>    But for now, hats off to the Most Successful Expansion Franchise in JADDL History, for posting the ninth highest regular season score ever, for knocking the 900-pound gorilla in the East&mdash;Jesus&hellip;yes, <i>that</i> Jesus&mdash;down a peg, and for continuing to rock some insanely sexy uniforms.
