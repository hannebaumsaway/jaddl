    	<li>What are the odds these replacement refs are moles planted by the NFL Referees Association to force the NFL to end the lockout? Surely they can&rsquo;t legitimately be <a target="_blank" href="http://deadspin.com/5941770/">this terrible</a>, can they? <a target="_blank" href="http://deadspin.com/5942358/the-lions-received-an-extra-timeout-in-a-game-they-won-with-10-seconds-left">Can they</a>???</li><br/>
        <li>What treasure will the waiver wire hold this year? And will the Chumps uncover it like they did a year ago, seeing as how they shit the bed in Week 1 (again)?</li><br/>
        <li>Speaking of Waiver Wire Warriors<sup>TM</sup>, the ones from the past two years&mdash;Cammy Cam Juice and Vick-in-a-Box&mdash;faced off to start this season in the Falcons/Shanks game. They were both outscored by Jay Cutler from the Shanks&rsquo; bench.</li><br/>
        <li>Are any of you owners out there just a <i>wee bit</i> worried that with the Torn Hoodie in hand and a Week 1 Briefly Badass, The Mighty Boom is going for total domination this year? If they grab 13 Badasses, the Eastern Goblet, and the Court-Ordered Limousine, do we simply shut the league down?</li><br/>
        <li>I was going to give The Lawrence Football Jesus a polite pat on the back for starting off the year 1-0, until I realized they did so a year ago as well&hellip;with more points (100.3).</li><br/>
        <li>Raise your hand if you knew the top three scorers out of the gate would be Matt Ryan, RG3, and Tony Romo&hellip;</li><br/>
        <li>Boom&rsquo;s Atlanta Falcons players (Ryan, Julio Jones, and Matt Bryant) would have beaten the Millennium Falcons and One Pump Chumps by themselves with their 72.1 combined points.</li><br/>
