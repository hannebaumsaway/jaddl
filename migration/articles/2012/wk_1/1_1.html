    Welcome, boys and girls, to another season of JADDL fake football!
<br/>    
<br/>    And damned if we didn&rsquo;t start the year off with some fantastic games. Headlining the week was a rivalry game right out of the gate: the <b>Red Hornets</b> hopping on a cross-town bus to face off against their city limits nemesis, <b>Team Hauloll</b>. Hauloll came into the game 5-3 lifetime against the Ginger Stingers, and had won four in a row prior to losing in downright embarrassing fashion to the hapless Hornets a year ago, 103.4&ndash;64.5.
<br/>    
<br/>    Hauloll wound up missing the postseason by two games anyway, so it didn&rsquo;t really matter in the grand scheme of things; in fact, the loss spurred Hauloll to two 100+ games to finish out the season. Jason talked at length about the psychological impact that Hornets loss had on his team.

<br/>    &ldquo;It made us mad.&rdquo;
<br/>    
<br/>    Angering the winningest franchise in the JADDL probably isn&rsquo;t the greatest thing that can happen to a team, especially when that franchise gets a chance at revenge so early the following season.
<br/>    
<br/>    Well, Hauloll&rsquo;s revenge was exacted, but it wasn&rsquo;t easy. The Hornets&mdash;fresh off their B+ Guti Grade&mdash;didn&rsquo;t back down an inch from the challenge, and forced Hauloll to scratch and clow all the way through Monday Night Football to finally secure a <b>111.6&ndash;99.2</b> victory. Jason&rsquo;s squad was led by Andre Johnson with 17.9 points, but it was their balance that really carried the day&mdash;they had five players score 15 or more in all.
<br/>    
<br/>    &ldquo;Just like my dad, the King of Marysville, always said: a properly loaded flatbed truck is a balanced one,&rdquo; said Jason following the game.
<br/>    
<br/>    The Red Hornets were more top-heavy than balanced, on the other hand; the Dolly Parton of fantasy football. Following that analogy, Tony Romo and Stevan Ridley were the Hornets&rsquo; tits, putting up 25.4 and 21.2 respectively. And no, I don&rsquo;t know who Stevan Ridley is. In that respect, could he be the new Arian Foster? You know, a runningback with a funny first name and normal last name who bursts onto the scene from nowhere to steal the hearts of fantasy footballers across the country? We&rsquo;ll see.
<br/>    
<br/>    In the meantime, Dan will have to console himself with Ridley&rsquo;s apparent potential while swallowing a season-opening loss.
<br/>    
<br/>    The game was still in doubt following Sunday&rsquo;s action. Only when Hauloll posted an additional 15 points on Monday night via the Ravens D/ST to outpace the 4.9 by the Hornets&rsquo; Robert Meachem was the game decided. Prior to that point, the margin was minuscule&mdash;a 96.6&ndash;94.3 barnburner.
<br/>    
<br/>    Now the doubt is squarely on the side of the Red Hornets for the time being, who surely remember going six weeks without a win to start the season a year ago. As for Hauloll, they can continue to focus on returning to the playoffs after last year&rsquo;s first-ever postseason whiff.
