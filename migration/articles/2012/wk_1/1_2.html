    One of the most ballsy things you can do in the sports world&mdash;you know, aside from actually <i>playing</i> the sport&mdash;is betting a bunch of money on a game.
<br/>    
<br/>    One of the least ballsy things you can do in the sports world is make a consequence-free bet on the outcome of a fantasy game.
<br/>    
<br/>    But fuck it, it&rsquo;s fun anyway. Such is the ideal that is bringing back the Fifth Reich&rsquo;s Picks&hellip;with a twist. Starting with Week 2 (because starting in Week 1 would have just been too on-the-nose), John Jordan and his dusty crystal ball will make their triumphant return.
<br/>    
<br/>    Not only is the picks segment coming back; it&rsquo;ll be more nimble than ever, thanks to the fact that it has <a href="http://jaddl.tumblr.com/post/31348447251/week-2-lines" target="_blank">moved to The DDL</a>. This takes the task of formatting emails or Word documents for the newsletter out of the picture, getting you the picks you crave even faster than before.
<br/>
<br/>    But wait! There&rsquo;s more! The picks are going to be presented in a new, sexy way via The Program That Will Never Die: <i>MS Paint</i>. That&rsquo;s right: John and Alex are bringing visual aids up in this bitch.
<br/>
<br/>    There&rsquo;s one more change to announce. John will be returning to pick <i>only</i> the games in the East Division.
<br/>
<br/>    Why?
<br/>    
<br/>    Because the picks for the West Division games will be handled by the Bad News Bensons&rsquo; front office, that&rsquo;s why. You see, that way Alex can avoid picking games involving his own franchise. Brilliant!
<br/>
<br/>    What are they going to do for the three interdivisional games, you ask?
<br/>    
<br/>    Um&hellip;
