    Those of you who can do so, dive back through your email inbox to the middle of August of 2007 (sorry Ian, you&rsquo;ll just have to read on). There, you should find a thread discussing the inaugural setup of the league that would become the JADDL&mdash;in fact, the name &ldquo;Jared Allen&rsquo;s DDs League&rdquo; is concocted in that very thread by yours truly.
<br/>    
<br/>    All in all, it&rsquo;s a fascinating discussion to look back on. Of note, ESPN is chosen to host the league over Yahoo! due to free live scoring; I&rsquo;m nominated to take the reins as commissioner (thanks Jimbo)&hellip;
<br/>    
<br/>    &hellip;And fractional scoring is discussed.
<br/>    
<br/>    Interestingly, if you&rsquo;ll recall, the JADDL didn&rsquo;t <i>have</i> fractional scoring in 2007. That email thread reveals that I considered it a plus that ESPN enabled us to &ldquo;choose <i>not</i> to allow fractional points.&rdquo; James mentioned that he actually liked fractional scoring, to which I replied that we could use it, but that &ldquo;some of you complained about it&rdquo; the year before.
<br/>    
<br/>    Fast forward a month. We all know the story: The Mighty Boom and Lawrence Football Jesus opened JADDL play with a 69&ndash;69 tie. In a Gmail chat with Nolan following the game, Nolan opines, &ldquo;The nice thing about [the decimal point system] is, it is almost impossible to have ties.&rdquo; Throughout 2007 there would end up being four ties (three of them involving Football Jesus, hilariously).
<br/>    
<br/>    Skip ahead to August of 2008. In a Gmail chat with James, I reveal that the JADDL&rsquo;s scoring system has been updated to use fractional scoring, saying this move &ldquo;should eliminate ties altogether.&rdquo;
<br/>    
<br/>    And it did, for three and a half years&hellip;until Week 8 of 2011. That&rsquo;s when the unthinkable happened: the Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks and In Pursuit of Perfection, LLC, both sat with identical scores when the dust settled, all the way down to the tenth of a point, 93.1 apiece. A tie. Fuck!
<br/>    
<br/>    &ldquo;Congrats on the tie guys!&rdquo; <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/LFootballJesus/status/132220525450756096?iid=am-111949529413203588046669458&nid=4+status_timestamp&uid=370441041">tweeted James</a>.
<br/>    
<br/>    Well, it happens, right? I mean, however statistically improbable it was with fractional scoring in place, it was bound to occur at some point. Once every four years is sufferable, right?
<br/>    
<br/>    <s>And we arrive at today&rsquo;s story. The tie is <i>back</i>. So soon? So soon. Almost exactly a year later. The scores are in, and two teams clocked in with 95.8. Two teams that played each other&hellip;The Mighty Boom and The IPA Connoisseur. To add to the disappointment, this was a game JADDL fans were eager to see; the two leaders of the league&rsquo;s respective divisions, both 5-1, both in the upper echelon of scoring. And we get a fucking tie that resolves nothing? Apparently the two teams were the proverbial unstoppable force and immovable object.
<br/>    
<br/>    But this story goes deeper than the tie itself. You see, in both ties since 2007, the affected GMs went to bed on Monday night thinking a victor had emerged from the melee, only to wake up on Tuesday morning and discover that ESPN had made a tweak to the scoring, resulting in a tie.</s>
<br/>    
<br/>    You see, gentlemen, the Tie is that annoying ex-girlfriend you broke up with years ago, whom you thought was out of your life forever, only to find her name keyed into the side of your car to remind you she&rsquo;s not letting you go so easily.
<br/>    
<br/>    Not that that&rsquo;s ever happened to me&hellip;
<br/>
<br/>    <span style="color:#C00"><i><b>Edit:</b> Nevermind. ESPN decided to wait until Thursday morning to change the game to a Boom victory, 96.2&ndash;95.8. So over the course of four days, Lannie went from a win, to a tie, to a loss. Ouch.</i></span>
