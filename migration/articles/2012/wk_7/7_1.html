    Manhattan is where Jacksons come to play with balls. <i>Foot</i>balls, you pervert.
<br/>    
<br/>    A year ago, the One Pump Chumps busted into the Newsletter in Week 2. That article featured receiver Vincent Jackson&mdash;with a strange Siamese cat-like face, I might add&mdash;due to a 29.2-point outburst. The next highest scorer for the Chumps? Running back <i>Fred</i> Jackson, with 28. OPC took down the Red Hornets in that contest, 132.1&ndash;77.6.
<br/>    
<br/>    Fast forward to 2012, Week 7. The now-defending champ Chumps are here in the Newsletter once again, and once again the feature is a Jackson. You might think it would have gone to Vincent, who again led the Chumps in scoring with 27.6. But we have to share the love here in the JADDL; where&rsquo;s the fun in featuring the same player for a team twice in a row? So we passed the torch to the second leading scorer for OPC&hellip;who, once again, turned out to be Fred Jackson (18). Weird&hellip;
<br/>    
<br/>    &ldquo;Stick with what you know,&rdquo; Jesse explained. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a big believer in that. The New York Yankees, Keystone Light, and Vincent and Fred Jackson. That&rsquo;s what I know. That&rsquo;s what I stick with.&rdquo;
<br/>    
<br/>    Jesse also appears, based on tweets, to be one of those KU basketball / K-State football fans, but we won&rsquo;t get into that just now.
<br/>    <div class="news-quote">Stick with what you know.&hellip;The New York Yankees, Keystone Light, and Vincent and Fred Jackson. That&rsquo;s what I know.<div class="author">Jesse</div></div>
<br/>    This year the unambiguously Jackson duo led OPC to a 133.5&ndash;84.2 victory over the Surrendering Longshanks. That&rsquo;s just 5.2 points away from the point differential from last year&rsquo;s featured Hornets conquest. Again: weird.
<br/>    
<br/>    Glancing down the scorecard, you&rsquo;ll see that the Chumps beat the Shanks in every head-to-head battle aside from two&mdash;James Jones and Stephen Gostkowski failed to outpace Reggie Wayne&rsquo;s corpse and Greg the Leg, respectively. That&rsquo;s domination. Six of the Chumps&rsquo; starters from this game are in the top 10 of their respective position rankings.
<br/>    
<br/>    The standings show the Chumps on the outside of the playoff race looking in at the moment, but don&rsquo;t sleep on &rsquo;em yet by any means. You see, they&rsquo;re currently <i>third</i> in the league in total points despite their modest 4-3 record, and they <i>are</i> the defending champs, after all.
<br/>    
<br/>    As for the Shanks, you&rsquo;re watching a dynasty die before your eyes. The move to Prairie Village did nothing for the franchise, as they currently sit second to last in points scored while giving up the second <i>most</i> points&hellip;a surefire recipe for complete suckage. They&rsquo;re KU: can&rsquo;t score, can&rsquo;t stop anyone. The Shanks have had 82.5 more points scored on them (757.7) than the second most unlucky team in the East (the Bensons, 675.2). Combine that with a measley 583.5 offensive total, and, well, you get 1-6.
<br/>    
<br/>    Enough talk about irrelevant teams. The Chumps wrap up interdivisional play with the revitalized Bad News Bensons, who suddenly find themselves alive again in the Eastern race after gaining a game (or, in Boom&rsquo;s case, half a game) on their entire division this past weekend. Win that one, and I doubt the other West teams will be excited to see the Chumps again down the home stretch of the regular season.
