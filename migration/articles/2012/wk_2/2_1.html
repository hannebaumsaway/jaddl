    In 2011, the One Pump Chumps put up 156. The year before that, In Pursuit of Perfection scored 154.6.
<br/>    
<br/>    Why am I telling you this? Because aside from those two moments, no other team in JADDL regular season history has scored more than the IPA Connoisseur did in its 150.4&ndash;87.1 beatdown of the Red Hornets this past weekend.
<br/>    
<br/>    That impressive outing has put IPA in as comfy a spot as a team can find itself after just two weeks: 2-0 and 76.2 points ahead of the also-undefeated Tulsa Angry Monkeys. It also gives braggart extraordinaire Lannie&mdash;the man who recently described his <a href="news/2012/wk_2/index.php?view=news&amp;yr=2012&amp;wk=2&amp;pg=2">unremarkable</a> franchise as &ldquo;very deserving for such a privilege&rdquo; as the number one overall pick in the JADDL draft&mdash;plenty to talk about.
<br/>    
<br/>    &ldquo;Of course I believe we have what it takes to win it all. Why wouldn&rsquo;t we? We had the top pick, we made the playoffs last year, and we have me as a GM.&rdquo;
<br/>    
<br/>    Well, I don&rsquo;t know about all that, but the Connoisseur did have plenty of firepower this weekend. Only one IPA player&mdash;the Chargers D/ST&mdash;failed to get into double figures (6). Four&mdash;<i>four!</i>&mdash;players scored in the 20s: Arian Foster (20.7), Philip Rivers (22.1), Victor Cruz (25.9), and Trent Richardson (26.5).
<br/>    <div class="news-quote">Of course I believe we have what it takes to win it all&hellip;We had the top pick, we made the playoffs last year, and we have me as a GM.<div class="author">Lannie</div></div>
<br/>    But how sustainable is this?
<br/>    
<br/>    Arian Foster is expected to put up sizeable numbers all season as the league&rsquo;s top pick. Rivers? C&rsquo;mon&hellip;we all know he&rsquo;s going to struggle often, sometimes horribly. Cruz is the epitome of hot &rsquo;n&rsquo; cold; in 2011, Cruz scored over 15 five times, and only once did he follow up such a performance with another 15+ the next week. He scored under five three times as well, and put up just 5.8 last week.
<br/>    
<br/>    Then again, who knows? Lannie will remind anyone who will listen that he led the league in scoring for nine weeks in 2011. IPA fans will remind <i>him</i> that he <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> lead the league in scoring when it mattered most&mdash;in Week 13. He <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> win the West Division. He <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> win a playoff game.
<br/>    
<br/>    He <i>did</i> talk a whole lot of shit in those nine weeks, though (Exhibit <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/lannie1982/status/113033712601534465">A</a> | <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/lannie1982/status/115513509680398336">B</a> | <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/lannie1982/status/116991070902030336">C</a> | <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/lannie1982/status/123552440472702976">D</a> | <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/lannie1982/status/124137613924896768">E</a> | <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/lannie1982/status/125717352863113216">F</a>). In all fairness, he <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/lannie1982/status/127235709785473024">opened the door</a> to this very mockery before the end: &ldquo;I will graciously accept any and all backlash and ridicule from my comments thus far if I happen to end this season sucking.&rdquo; The Connoisseur losing four of their last five certainly qualifies as ending the season sucking.
<br/>    
<br/>    As for the poor Hornets, they appear here for the second straight week on the wrong side of the feature. So, with their franchise sitting at 0-2, how prevalent is the painful memory of the 0-6 start from a year ago in the minds of Hornets fans?
<br/>    
<br/>    Once they wake up, we&rsquo;ll ask them.
