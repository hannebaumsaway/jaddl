    When you&rsquo;re finished reading this article, click <a href="news/2012/wk_2/index.php?view=league&amp;which=stats">here</a>. Scroll down a bit and you&rsquo;ll see all the franchises of the JADDL, stacked up in descending order by prestigiousness.
<br/>    
<br/>    Keep scrolling and you&rsquo;ll eventually spot the Tulsa Angry Monkeys, IPA Connoisseur, and Lawrence Football Jesus&hellip;just above the four inactive former franchises listed for posterity&rsquo;s sake.
<br/>    
<br/>    In case you weren&rsquo;t following along just then, I&rsquo;m pointing out to you that the Monkeys, IPA, and Football Jesus are the three <i>least</i> prestigious teams in the league today. Those three franchises combine for a .396 winning percentage, four total playoff appearances, and just two trophies (both Torn Hoodies, which is the only award not actually earned on the imaginary field) that aren&rsquo;t Briefly Badasses. This bleak trio also collectively holds zero league records to date.
<br/>    
<br/>    Have I made my point?
<br/>    
<br/>    Good. Because at this point in the young season you can throw all that shit out the imaginary window.
<br/>    
<br/>    Two weeks. Six wins. No losses. And so far their performances don&rsquo;t appear to be fluky. The Connoisseur has <a href="news/2012/wk_2/index.php?view=news&amp;yr=2012&amp;wk=2&amp;pg=1">certainly earned their standing</a>. Football Jesus is <a href="news/2012/wk_2/index.php?view=standings&amp;which=power&amp;yr=2012&amp;wk=2" target="_blank">second in the East in scoring</a>. The Monkeys have had a more fortunate go of things than the other two, averaging just a 10.5-point margin of victory in their two wins&mdash;IPA&rsquo;s mark is 43.9, while Jesus&rsquo; is 28.9.
<br/>    
<br/>    This is all meaningless so early in the season, of course, but it&rsquo;ll be interesting to follow nonetheless. The Monkeys and IPA face off next week, so one of those two will be hampered with their first loss in short order. On the right-hand side of the JADDL world, Jesus&rsquo; path seems more clear thus far, with the two-time defending division champ Bensons struggling out of the gate. Then again, there&rsquo;s always The Mighty Boom to contend with, who have scored more points than Jesus in the first two weeks and against whom Jesus is 2-4-1 lifetime.
<br/>    
<br/>    At any rate, these teams don&rsquo;t get called out for something <i>good</i> very often, so it&rsquo;s nice to be able to write this piece. Like spare change to a homeless guy, the first two weeks of 2012 have likely breathed disproportionate life into three franchises for whom winning is a delicacy to be savored while it lasts.
