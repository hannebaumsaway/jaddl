    It&rsquo;s that time of year again&hellip;time to look at all the possibilities that still lie before us for the JADDL playoffs. We&rsquo;ve got some pretty competitive races going on, so the home stretch should prove wildly entertaining. Read on, dear owners, to find out where you stand and who you need to root for (and against) in these final three weeks.
<br/>    
<br/>    Ryan and Dan, go grab a soda or something.

<br/>    <div class="section-head">The West</div>
<br/>    The <b>IPA Connoisseur</b> is in fantastic shape after bringing home a Briefly Badass as the only team to break a hundy in Week 10 with its 113.9&ndash;86.5 win over the One Pump Chumps. The victory keeps IPA perfect against its intradivision foes so far this year, and puts it atop the West in terms of overall record, division record, <i>and</i> points. Not a bad place to be with three weeks left in the regular season, eh? However, The Connoisseur hasn&rsquo;t quite clinched just yet. If they lose out, they&rsquo;ll sit at 7-6 while the Monkeys, IPP, and Chumps could all reach 8-5 with their remaining schedules.
<br/>    
<br/>    Speaking of the <b>Angry Monkeys</b>, they&rsquo;re in solid shape themselves despite having the least amount of points in the division. Believe it or not, they&rsquo;re solid enough to be able to <i>lose out</i> and still move on with a 6-7 (5-5) record, <i>if</i>&mdash;take a deep breath&mdash;the Chumps lose to Hauloll and the Hornets, and Hauloll turns around and loses to IPP and the Hornets as well. In other words, the Monkeys would become the biggest Hornets fans on the planet. The Monkey&rsquo;s quickest and safest route is to beat IPP; in that case, they could lose their other two and still coast onward no matter what else happens. Win two or three and they&rsquo;re also golden in any scenario.
<br/>    
<br/>    For <b>In Pursuit of Perfection</b>, there are two primary routes: beat the Monkeys in their head-to-head matchup&mdash;if this is IPP&rsquo;s <i>only</i> remaining win, shit potentially gets crazy&mdash;or win their other two games (against Hauloll and IPA) should they lose to the Monkeys. Now, you know how I said shit could get crazy if IPP goes 1-2 with a win over the Monkeys? Well, if the Monkeys beat The Connoisseur and Hauloll beats the Chumps while losing to the Hornets, there would be a <i>four-way tie</i> in the West at 7-6. The Monkeys would be in with a 6-4 division record, and the Chumps would be out with 4-6. IPP and Hauloll, however, would be locked at 5-5 apiece. Who advances between those two? Hauloll, as they would be 2-0 head-to-head versus IPP.
<br/>    
<br/>    Remember, boys and girls, the tiebreakers go in this order: 1) division record, 2) head-to-head results, 3) points.
<br/>    
<br/>    From <b>Team Hauloll&rsquo;s</b> perspective, the easy answer is to win out and get to 8-5 (6-4). There is a scenario that would result in a four-way tie at 8-5, hilariously, but Hauloll would advance and IPP would be left out in the cold due to the head-to-head tiebreaker discussed above. For fun, let me remind you that the Hauloll-IPP game back in Week 5 was decided by 1.4 points. But the <i>real</i> tiebreaker fun would come if Hauloll and IPP finish 7-6 (5-5) with Hauloll losing to IPP this coming weekend. Then head-to-head would be eliminated as they would have gone 1-1 against each other, and it would come down to points. Right now, Hauloll has a 2.7-point lead over In Pursuit. Hauloll and IPP are so close in this race, they should probably just go ahead and get married.
<br/>    
<br/>    The <b>One Pump Chumps</b> control their own destiny as well (the West is a clusterfuck, I told you). Go 3-0 and you&rsquo;re in, Jesse. If OPC is going to drop a game, they actually want to do it to the Hornets, so as not to give a win to the Monkeys or Hauloll. In this case, they would need help from Hauloll in the forms of a win over IPP and a loss to the Hornets. If the Chumps drop two of the remaining three, they&rsquo;re done.
<br/>    
<br/>    As for the <b>Red Hornets</b>, LOL. But seriously, as you can see from the repeated mentions in the above scenarios, the &rsquo;Nets have a pretty substantial role to play in this shakeout, since every team above them is still very much in the mix.
<br/>    
<br/>    <div class="section-head">The East</div>
<br/>    Congrats to <b>The Mighty Boom</b>, which has secured a playoff spot! Pete, your division foes <a href="http://jaddl.clanteam.com/index.php?view=news&yr=2010&wk=5&pg=1" target="_blank">still hate you</a>. One more win and Boom can bring home its first Eastern Goblet as well. Lose out, and Jesus and the Falcons have a shot at it.
<br/>    
<br/>    <b>Football Jesus</b> could still win the Goblet, it&rsquo;s true, but they could also still miss the playoffs entirely. Lose out and they&rsquo;d miss out, since one of those losses would come at the hands of the Falcons, which would move the Falcons to at least seven wins while Jesus would be stuck at six, and another would be to Odouls, which would then have at <i>least</i> six wins and the division record tiebreaker over Jesus. There is a scenario which would result in a three-way tie at 7-6 between Jesus, Odouls, and the Falcons&hellip;Odouls would be in with a 6-4 division record, and the Jesus-Falcons deadlock would come down to head-to-head&mdash;the two play each other in Week 12, while the Falcons crushed Jesus in Week 4&mdash;and possibly points beyond that if Jesus were to beat the Falcons in the rematch. Jesus currently holds a narrow 8.4-point advantage over Millennium.
<br/>    
<br/>    For the <b>Millennium Falcons</b>, see above. They&rsquo;re in an almost identical position as Jesus, with the exception being that they have to play Boom while Jesus gets Odouls (they both have the pleasure of playing the &rsquo;Shanks, in addition to each other).
<br/>    
<br/>    <b>Team Odouls</b> could actually make it through with just one more win&mdash;provided that win comes against Football Jesus, and provided Jesus loses out entirely. In that case, both Odouls and Jesus would be 6-7, and Odouls would take it with a 5-5 division record over Jesus&rsquo;s 4-6 mark. Win out, and Odouls is in. Win two of three, and they&rsquo;d need either the Falcons or Jesus to drop a couple.
<br/>    
<br/>    <b>The Bad News Bensons</b> haven&rsquo;t been mentioned yet, but they&rsquo;re still in the hunt as well&hellip;barely. They have to win out, first and foremost. Secondly, they need either the Falcons or Jesus to <i>lose</i> out. If it&rsquo;s the Falcons who lose out, the Bensons need Odouls to lose to Boom or Jesus to keep them at 6-7. If it&rsquo;s Jesus who loses out, then the Bensons need Odouls to lose to Boom (having beaten Jesus in this scenario). Whew.
<br/>    
<br/>    The most significant role the <b>Fightin&rsquo; Longshanks</b> have left to play is potential spoiler. In the event that the Bensons win out and Jesus beats the Falcons in Week 12, Week 13 will feature two crucial games for the &ldquo;Falcons lose out&rdquo; scenario explained above for the Bensons. The Bensons would need the &rsquo;Shanks to beat the Falcons, and potentially would need Jesus to knock off Odouls, if Odouls beat Boom the week prior.
<br/>    
<br/>    &hellip;So, you get all that?
