	If your JADDL obsession tips the scale, you may have already noticed some additions to this site in the off-season.
<br/>
<br/>    Assuming you haven&rsquo;t, here&rsquo;s a little cheatsheet to help you uncover the new wonders the site has to behold:
<br/>
<br/>    <ul>
    	<li><b>Article page navigation.</b> I&rsquo;m talking about the little arrows above the articles. Now you can traverse from week to week within the news articles without resorting back to the site navigation bar&rsquo;s menus. Handy, huh?<br/><br/></li>
        <li><b>Franchise carousel.</b> That jumpy little bar of team logos that now hovers above the main body of the site, giving you quick access to a team&rsquo;s bio page from anywhere on the site.<br/><br/></li>
        <li><b><a href="news/2012/preseason/index.php?view=league&amp;which=records">Records page</a>.</b> A convenient place for you to gather talking points as you prepare to talk shit on a division rival, perhaps, or maybe just a way for you to brush up on your general JADDL knowledge to wow fans at a cocktail party.<br/><br/></li>
        <li><b>Article listings on team bio pages.</b> Have you ever wished you could see all the articles in which your team was featured or mentioned? Now you can! Just scroll down to the bottom of your team&rsquo;s bio page and bask in the glory of all your media coverage. Of course, not all of your mentions are going to be glowing&hellip;<br/><br/></li>
    </ul>
