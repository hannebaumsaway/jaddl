	Here we are again. Five years of the JADDL have come and gone. Four years of the RBSA came and went before that.
<br/>    
<br/>    And we have yet to see a repeat champion.
<br/>    
<br/>    That can lead us to only one conclusion: winning the league title is really fucking hard. A lot of it is luck, to be sure, especially once you&rsquo;re in the playoffs. But you have to build a team that can last through the grueling regular season and still have enough magic in the tank to win two or three more against the league&rsquo;s other elite.
<br/>    
<br/>    That&rsquo;s just what the One Pump Chumps built in 2011. The luck came early, as we all know, in the form of a dismal Week 1 performance which positioned OPC to snag Cammy Cam Juice off the waiver wire, a coup that would lead the Chumps to a 10-2 regular season close after starting 0-1 without Newton, a first round bye, and a Court-Ordered Limousine when all was said and done.
<br/>    
<br/>    But Cammy Cam didn&rsquo;t do it alone.
<br/>    
<br/>    The Chumps&rsquo; first round draft pick, Maurice Jones-Drew, put up the third best numbers for a running back in the league&hellip;appropriate, considering he was the third RB taken overall. Rob Gronkowski stopped cavorting with porn stars long enough to become the #1 tight end in the JADDL, posting an astounding 243 total points&mdash;for comparison&rsquo;s sake, much-ballyhooed Jimmy Graham tallied 195 points as the #2 TE.
<br/>    
<br/>    So just as it takes a village to raise an idiot&mdash;er, child&mdash;it takes a team to hoist the Limo.

<br/>	For their repeat bid, the Chumps have decided to go to war with LeSean McCoy, Fred Jackson, and Eli Manning leading the charge. However, that Manning declaration may end up being premature despite his third-round-pick status. In what may be an attempt to recreate the Cammy Cam magic of a year ago, Jesse picked up Russell Wilson from free agency following the draft, clearly impressed by Wilson&rsquo;s dismantling of the preseason patsy Chiefs. Will Wilson play a role in OPC&rsquo;s rise or demise? Impossible to say at this point, of course.
<br/>
<br/>	For his part, Manning is playing the chip-on-the-shoulder card to perfection, at least to the media. &ldquo;With my brother coming back from the dead and my owner picking up another QB, my motivation-o-meter is off the charts,&rdquo; Manning told reporters in a training camp press conference.
<br/>    
<br/>    But one thing&rsquo;s for sure: the Chumps&mdash;now a bona fide dynasty with multiple championships&mdash;won&rsquo;t be sneaking up on anyone anymore.
