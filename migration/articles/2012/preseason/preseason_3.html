    Perhaps the greatest tradition of this league is its ability to improve upon itself year after year.
<br/>    
<br/>    2007 saw the birth of the JADDL Newsletter, in the form of emailed Microsoft Word documents (ghetto). 2008 improved upon the newsletter experience with a more official looking PDF format. &rsquo;09 gave us our first non-email access via Dropbox, and 2010 made the biggest leap forward to date with the introduction of this very website. 2011 revamped the site significantly, streamlining it for sexy viewing on a tablet or mobile phone as well as a computer. 2011 also saw the official use of Twitter for league communications. In 2012 this site has received some <a href="news/2012/preseason/index.php?view=news&amp;yr=2012&amp;wk=preseason&amp;pg=2">minor enhancements</a> to make it more robust.
<br/>    
<br/>    But this year&rsquo;s main league enhancement has come not from this site, but in the form of another site altogether: <a target="_blank" href="http://jaddl.tumblr.com">The DDL blog</a>.
<br/>    
<br/>    This blog&mdash;created by James (who else?)&mdash;fancies itself as &ldquo;<i>the JADDL newsletter, except in 2012 and without all of the puns.</i>&rdquo; What it really is, in essence, is a virtual water cooler at which league owners can pose questions or musings, take issue with an article written here, talk shit on fellow owners, or opine on happenings in the NFL.
<br/>    
<br/>    But what The DDL <i>represents</i> is yet another step forward in the involvement of the owners in the league as a whole, and their (your) investment in its continued badassness.
<br/>    
<br/>    The blog has already spawned debates about <a target="_blank" href="http://jaddl.tumblr.com/post/27411321852/east-is-better">division superiority</a>, a <a target="_blank" href="http://jaddl.tumblr.com/image/27841275302">baby announcement</a>, some pretty hilarious <a target="_blank" href="http://jaddl.tumblr.com/page/2">pictures and videos</a>, a very thorough draft recap (<a target="_blank" href="http://jaddl.tumblr.com/post/30393033168/1st-draft-recap-of-the-year-phase-one-the-east">East</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://jaddl.tumblr.com/post/30404913503/draft-recap-phase-ii-west-drops-ball">West</a>), some <a target="_blank" href="http://jaddl.tumblr.com/post/30664120280/bold-not-so-bold-predictions-for-2012">predictions</a>, and even a <a target="_blank" href="http://jaddl.tumblr.com/post/30803590932/labor-day-gambling-problems">gambling rundown</a>.
<br/>    
<br/>    The only potential issue in The DDL (aside from getting regular contributions from people other than James or Alex) is the name itself. The <i>JA</i> in <i>JADDL</i>, as we all know, stands for our esteemed spiritual and figurative leader, Jared Allen. Removing him from the equation seems like a potential slap in his chiseled face, but Mr. Allen could not be reached for comment on the matter.
<br/>    
<br/>    At any rate, the blog is (hopefully) here to stay, and the potential for its impact on how JADDL owners interact with one another throughout the fantasy football season and beyond is boundless.
