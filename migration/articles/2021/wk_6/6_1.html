	When the league did the new thing this summer where we reshuffled the divisions by letting last year's division winners pick their mates, playground dodgeball style, the Red Hornets were the number one overall pick. That made sense, considering the Hornets have the fewest wins (19) and least points scored (5,464.2, which is 105.1 per game) of any team in the league over the previous four seasons.<br>
<br>
	But that's how it's <i>been</i>. How it's <i>going</i> as we near the halfway point of 2021 is a different story.<br>
<br>
	The headline of that story is that after the 190.8-155.9 defeat of Zombie Boom (Zomboom?), the Hornets sit in first place in the Old Big 8 division and are second in the entire league in points, behind only mighty IPP. They've got six players in the top 10 of their respective position groups: Lamar Jackson (QB 4), Jonathan Taylor (RB 5), Noah Fant (TE 7), Justin Jefferson (WR 10), Kirk Cousins (QB 10)...oh, and we mustn't forget Dan "Romans" Carlson (K 4)!<br>
<br>
	To get past Zomboom, they got a big contribution from Leonard Fournette as well, to the tune of 30.7 points.<br>
<br>
	<div class="section-header">Longshanks 137.0 | Hauloll 135.8</div>
	"Fantasy football sucks." That was Jason's take on this brutal game, as the battered and bruised Longshanks (or Zombie Shanks, as Alex dubbed them) eeked out an impossible victory over Hauloll. No one foresaw Taylor Heinicke and Terry McLaurin combining for a paltry 16 points against the Chiefs D. Slightly less surprising was Daniel Jones scoring 4 points, considering he scored 4.7 a week ago. That's—well, that's not good.<br>
<br>
	But the real story of this game was the ending, in which DK Metcalf waited until the last possible moment to make the catch that put the Shanks over the top—only to fumble it away. Had the defense recovered that fumble, Jason would have clung to a 0.8-point victory. But they didn't, so he didn't. A game of inches, indeed.<br>
<br>
	<div class="section-header">Jesus 145.3 | Lanniesters 133.9</div>
	Well, Geno Smith was a total bust in his first week of action off the wire, but Najee Harris is rolling. This was his fourth straight game of 20+ points, as he and Aaron Jones give Jesus one of the best RB corps in the league.<br>
<br>
	This is the fourth time in the last six seasons in which Jesus has started 4-2, by the way. They only did so once in their first nine seasons before that, so there's no doubting the positive trajectory of James' franchise.<br>
<br>
	<div class="section-header">Saquonda 115.3 | Bensons 124.6</div>
	Sometimes you just tip your cap to the schedule maker. It's always a nice treat (hey, it's "spooooooky season" after all...) to score the third fewest points of the week and win, because you played the team with the fewest points for the week. But Alex doesn't have to apologize for that shit, because we all know it can work the other way around in this wacky, stupid, awesome game.<br>
<br>
	<div class="section-header">Monkeys 203.3 | Odouls 137.2</div>
	Maybe I should just copy and paste "[insert team here] just scored the second most points in a game in league history!" at this point, because that just happened for the second straight week. Congrats, Monkeys, you unoriginal hacks.<br>
<br>
	When you get five players to eclipse the 20-point mark—including 37.6 from King Henry—your team is going to do good things, and winning by 66 is generally viewed as a good thing.<br>
<br>
	Fun fact: Odouls played some dude named Kenneth Gainwell, which sounds 100% like a John Grisham character, and not at all like a professional football player.<br>
<br>
	<div class="section-header">IPP 163.4 | Falcons 117.6</div>
	Say hello to the league's only 5-1 team. It's nice to be able to count on a 40-point floor from your two QBs every time out, and then get random 30+ point contributions from guys like Jaylen Waddle. We'll see if the Kareem Hunt injury slows down this locomotive, or if IPP just keeps rolling.
