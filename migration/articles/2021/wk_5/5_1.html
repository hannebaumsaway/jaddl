	Once upon a time, scoring 202 points would have been a feat worthy of a parade. That was before all you fuckers decided to add the "Offensive Player" roster slot, effectively turning the JADDL into a 2-QB league—and ruining this site's historical stats in the process.<br>
<br>
	Still, the Millennium Falcons became just the third team in league history to eclipse the 200-point mark, following in the footsteps of the Longshanks (200.6) and current record-holder IPP (209.4) from a year ago. Perhaps the most impressive part of this particular performance was the fact that the Falcons put up that lofty number while having 6.5 points <i>subtracted</i> from their total, thanks to the Browns D/ST. Turns out, getting 70.4 points from your two starting WRs is a good way to do business in the ol' JADDL.<br>
<br>
	Oh, and if I would have asked you who you thought the top three RBs in the league are, would you have included Austin Ekeler in your answer? Because he's currently RB 3 after putting up 32.9 points against Saquonda Forever this past weekend.<br>
<br>
	<div class="section-header">Jesus 141.0 | Odouls 139.0</div>
	Wooooo, this is what a rivalry game is all about! A two-point spread and a victory by a team quarterbacked by the dynamic duo of Jacoby Brissett and Mac Jones. Two guys whose parents decided the names "Jacob" and "Mack" were just too on the nose. I'm chalking this Odouls loss up to the fact that the Bills felt no need to run the ball with Devin Singletary against the Chiefs, since Josh Allen could get a 50-yard bomb against Dirty Dan Sorensen whenever he wished.<br>
<br>
	<div class="section-header">Bensons 153.0 | Lanniesters 163.7</div>
	Is it panic time in the Bensons front office yet? By my quick database querying, only twice in league history has a 1-4 team gone on to make the playoffs. That works out to just a 7% chance. That's bad news for Bad News. The silver lining, however, is that one of those two teams—Team Hauloll in 2019—went on to win the whole damn thing in Jared Bowl XIII. So, you know...#hope.<br>
<br>
	The Lanniesters, meanwhile, have rattled off two straight wins after starting the year 0-3. Since I already had the query created, I checked out how 0-3 teams have done historically, and the numbers are nearly as grim: only 11% of them have made the postseason, and none of those have made a Jared Bowl appearance. But there's a first time for everything, and maybe Tom fucking Brady (39.7 points this week) can blaze that trail in his advanced years.<br>
<br>
	<div class="section-header">Monkeys 168.8 | Boom 142.7</div>
	It's not every day you get 42 points from Mark Andrews, so you don't want to waste it when it happens. Despite getting 6 points from QB1 Jared Goff—who, as a friendly reminder, does not know in which directions the sun rises and sets—the Monkeys cashed the Andrews performance in, dealing a devastating blow to The Mighty Boom, who seemed poised to survive leaving Justin Herbert's 46.7 points on the bench, right up until MNF.<br>
<br>
	<div class="section-header">Longshanks 138.5 | IPP 163.6</div>
	IPP just keeps on keepin' on with another solid week thanks to major contributions from—checks notes—Dawson Knox and Kareem Hunt. The 'Shanks, meanwhile, are in a world of hurt, both figuratively and literally. Russell Wilson went down for 4-8 weeks, joining Jarvis Landry, D.J. Chark, and JuJu Smith-Schuster on the IR. The lineup which remains is fairly laughable, let's be honest.<br>
<br>
	<div class="section-header">Hornets 166.9 | Hauloll 90.3</div>
	Well, it was fun while it lasted. When Hauloll decided to fall off the undefeated wagon, they fell off <i>hard</i>. 90.3 points? What the fuck. Taylor Heinicke remembered he was Taylor Heinicke. Daniel Jones remembered he was Daniel Jones (and got concussed, I think). Terry McLaurin remembered he had Taylor Heinicke throwing him the ball. The result of all that recollection was a 77-point beatdown at the hands of the Hornets, who got 43.8 points from Lamar Jackson to more than offset the 13.4 they got from—LOL—Kirk Cousins.
