	Last year's Jared Bowl was an instant classic. It involved a 57-point comeback in the 11th hour during MNF, behind undoubtedly the greatest QB/WR stack performance in Jared Bowl history. Best bros Josh Allen and Stefon Diggs combined for 78 points to bring home a fourth Court-Ordered Limousine for the Longshanks, and stitch a fourth star onto those trademark snowman uniforms.
<br>
<br>	It involved accusations of sandbagging from jealous colleagues in other front offices.
<br>
<br>	But perhaps most significantly, it involved a crushed and dismayed New Guy Nate, who thought he was going to waltz into the most prestigious fantasy football league on the planet and win the whole fuckin' thing in his fourth year.
<br>
<br>	"Diggs and Allen—my god!" was all he managed to say, as his championship dreams withered and died that frosty December evening. But it's a new season, and Nate unveiled a fresh look and label in the hopes of finishing the job with some new mojo this time around. That mission included circling this past weekend, as Saquonda Forever would get another shot at the Fightin' Longshanks. A little revenge—however unsatisfying a Week 4 win would be compared to a Jared Bowl loss—perhaps?
<br>
<br>	Well. No. The Shanks poured it on last year's runners up once again, 184.6–157.3.
<br>
<br>	Unfortunately for Saquonda, the Longshanks seem to be on their own mission, to run it back and be the first franchise to five titles. That mission has entailed some aggressive management so far, such as the trade to get Matthew Stafford (QB 7) in exchange for Justin Herbert (QB 24), with Corey Davis (WR 19) thrown into the deal, who replaced JuJu Smith-Schuster (WR 67) in the starting lineup for the Shanks.
<br>
<br>	They also spent 46% of their FAAB on Cordarrelle Patterson—a head-scratcher for many at the time. But with injuries to Josh Jacobs and Jarvis Landry, and with Joe Mixon always being one snap away from injury himself, the Shanks needed the flexibility that the RB/WR-eligible Patterson provides. Patterson has responded by scoring 64.6 points in his two weeks with the defending champs thus far. Not too shabby.
<br>
<br>	The real irony in all this? These key post-draft additions to the Longshanks' roster were all supplied by bitter rival Mighty Boom—Pete dropped Patterson after Week 2.
<br>
<br>	The Shanks better not get cocky after their hot start, though. Four of the last seven defending champs started the following year 3-1, and as we know full well, none of them went on to repeat.
<br>
<br>	<div class="section-header">Odouls 114.8 | Lanniesters 116.0</div>
	Oh my. Jones: <i>Never put your faith in Derek Carr!</i> Shouldn't we know that by now? Odouls had fought back to take the lead over The Lanniesters in the waning moments of the weekend, when Derek Carr decided to throw a nice tight spiral directly to an opposing defensive back, taking 2 points—and the win—off the board for Odouls.
<br>
<br>	When you trot out Jalen Hurts, and he gives you 17 more points than Tom Brady gives your opponent, and you still manage to lose, it's going to hurt more than usual. But hey, congrats to Lannie on his first win of the season!
<br>
<br>	<div class="section-header">Jesus 120.3 | Boom 112.5</div>
	In the only other game of the week that came down to MNF, it looked for the briefest of moments like Boom was going to be able to ride Justin "Not Matt Stafford" Herbert to victory. Then Henry Ruggs III caught a Carr bomb (see what I did there?) late in the game, allowing Jesus to pull away once and for all. Jesus, by the way, quietly has the top RB corps in the league, with Aaron Jones (RB 3) and Najee Harris (RB 4).
<br>
<br>	As for Boom, the news isn't all bad. Kyler Murray is legit. But then I heard David Montgomery is going to miss four to five weeks, so the news is pretty bad still.
<br>
<br>	<div class="section-header">Monkeys 151.4 | Hauloll 181.1</div>
	Hauloll is rollin', y'all. They're undefeated. They lead the entire league in points scored. They haven't scored less than 150 points in any game this year. They were one of the strongest teams in the league a year ago before their shocking quarterfinal defeat at the hands of the Trumpster Fires. And now they're the JADDL's last hope for that elusive undefeated season.
<br>
<br>	And this is all while being quarterbacked by Taylor Heinicke and Daniel Jones. Hell, Jason even left Terry McLaurin (WR 5) on the bench, where he scored 30 points, just to fuck with the Monkeys.
<br>
<br>	<div class="section-header">Hornets 150.2 | IPP 199.7</div>
	Speaking of rolling, Hauloll's fellow divisionmate IPP is humming along as well. After a rocky start—and a loss—In Pursuit has put up 183.0, 166.1, and 199.7 in their last three games. Damn. If Hauloll is winning despite their QBs, IPP is winning <i>because</i> of them. Mahomes has to keep scoring more and more to make up for his shitshow defense, and Aaron Rodgers has recaptured his manbun-powered inner chakra. The Bills D/ST has also scored 23+ in two of its four starts, which is helpful.
<br>
<br>	Nolan hasn't been to the postseason since 2017, but the West(ish) Coast Avengers division sure looks like it's going to be one of the multiple-team participants in this year's playoffs.
<br>
<br>	<div class="section-header">Bensons 145.1 | Falcons 105.1</div>
	This Family Feud was a snooze-fest. The Bensons got their first W of the season—and ended a three-game losing streak to their rivals—behind a 39.2-point outburst from Deebo Samuel.
<br>
<br>	The Falcons curiously decided to go with a single QB, decided that solo QB should be Teddy Bridgewater, and watched him unsurprisingly shit the bed with 6.8 points.
