	Nothing like starting the season off with a marquee matchup, and that's exactly what we got as Mighty Boom faced off against Team Hauloll in the opener over the weekend. Historically speaking, Boom and Hauloll are first and third in all-time win percentage, first and second in total wins, and second and first in playoff wins, respectively. Oh, and they've also won six league titles and nine division titles between them.<br>
<br>
	This battle, though, was all about Hauloll. They put up the second most points of the weekend in a 165.9–145.7 victory over Boom, and start the year off atop the newly minted West(ish) Division. The game was still in the balance until Monday Night Football, but all drama was dashed pretty quickly at that point, thanks to Hauloll getting a 56-point influx from the combined efforts of Ty'Son Williams, Darren Waller, and Justin Tucker. This victory is undoubtedly even sweeter for Jason considering he got 2.6 points <i>combined</i> from his QB1 (Ryan "Still in the League" Fitzmagic) and RB1 Raheem Mostert.<br>
<br>
	The celebration was short-lived, however, as Jason found out a day later that Mostert is now out for the season.<br>
<br>
	Boom's game, meanwhile, could adequately summed up as "meh." The Kyler Murray and CeeDee "Not C.D." Lamb picks looks like they're going to be good ones, but no one else did anything extraordinary. And we'll have to see if Pete comes to regret his preseason trade of Matthew "Not a Lion Anymore" Stafford and Corey Davis for Justin Herbert, who was, uh, not great in his debut.<br>

	"I motion we move to full PPR." – Alex, July 2020</i><br><br>

	It only took one week for us to get our first heartbreaking loss of the season. Going into MNF, Alex had a 3.8-point lead and Mark Andrews left to combat. Normally, you'd think it'd be a mere formality to watch Andrews get 4+ points with ease, so where's the heartbreak? Well, since Lamar Jackson was busy fumbling everything he touched, he didn't have much time or targets for Andrews, who ended up with just 2 yards receiving for the night—on 3 catches. Yes, the ol' PPR format came back to bite the Bensons squarely in the ass.<br><br>

	<div class="section-header">Longshanks 167.9 | Lanniesters 148.6</div>
	There's no playbook to starting a title defense—evidenced by the fact that we still have yet to see anyone successfully defend a title—but snagging a Briefly Badass out of the gate can't be a bad thing. Matthew Stafford and Corey Davis barely had time to unpack after being traded to the Shanks from Boom, yet they managed to go out there and combine for 55 points for the reigning champs. That was enough to overcome the opening Thursday Night salvo from the Lanniesters with new Subway spokesman Tom Brady (29.0) and Antonio Brown (25.7), who somehow still isn't in jail.<br><br>

	<div class="section-header">Jesus 157.9 | Saquonda 133.4</div>
	The surprising Jared Bowl run from a season ago seems like a distant, foggy memory right now for the newly christened Saquonda Forever squad. Their 133.4 points were good for third from the bottom of the league, as titular character Saquon Barkley netted a measly 3.7 points—which, needless to say, wasn't enough.<br><br>

	Jesus, meanwhile, hit the trifecta (holy trinity?) by getting strong outings from a QB (Famous Jameis! 31.5), RB (C-Mac, 27.7), and WR (Amari Cooper, 38.9).<br><br>

	<div class="section-header">Hornets 157.9 | Falcons 117.3</div>
	The Hornets rounded out the perfect start from the Old Big 8 Division by dispatching the powerless Millennium Falcons behind a well-balanced attack paced by noted meathead Rob Gronkowski and his 29 points. The Falcons countered with a solid day from Nick Chubb, and—oh, that's actually the only positive outcome for the Falcons on the weekend. They do have a kicker named Younghoe, though, so that's pretty fun.<br><br>

	<div class="section-header">Odouls 158.6 | IPP 104.3</div>
	One may be excused for not feeling confident in a QB tandem of Jalen Hurts and Derek Carr. No matter: they trotted out there and put up 28.6 and 24.0 points, respectively, anyway. That was more than enough to overcome In Pursuit of Perfection, which was a long fucking ways from perfection this weekend. To have Patrick Mahomes give you 35.2 points and <i>still</i> score just 104.3 total is almost an accomplishment in itself, if you think about it. But no one should think about this performance ever again. And they won't.
