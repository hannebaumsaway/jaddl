	Here is something that's true: the Bad News Bensons have won their division each of the last two seasons. Here's something else that's true: the Bad News Bensons have finished each of the last two regular seasons with losing records. Pretty crazy that both those facts can coexist, isn't it? And we didn't even need any warped mental alternative-facts-fake-news gymnastics bullshit to make it happen! It's just plain old-fashioned true. The Bensons won their division with a 6-7 record two years running.<br>
<br>
    Could they do it again?<br>
<br>
    Obviously, 6-7 records are a thing of the past thanks to the new 14-game schedule we've got. But the leader in the Winterfell clubhouse is the Millennium Falcons at a decidedly uninspiring 5-5, and in addition to their two divisional rivals, they've got games remaining against two of the league's strongest teams, in the Angry Monkeys (7-3) and IPP (7-3). The Bensons also get to play each Winterfell foe again, as well as a tough out against Team Hauloll, but they also get to play Football Jesus, who is dead last in points scored league-wide, and has scored under 100 in two of its last four games.<br>
<br>
    I don't know, guys...I'm smelling a 6-8 division title for the Lucky Break Bears.<br>
<br>
	<div class="section-header">Hauloll 138.5 | IPP 136.9</div>
    When two of the top four scoring teams get together for a brawl, you expect a good game. And I'd call a game with fewer than two points of separation a damn good one. Patrick Mahomes had a mighty resurgence for IPP—unfortunately for Nomac, it was powered in large part by Tyreek Hill, who suits up for Jason and Team Hauloll. And more unfortunately for Nomac, Aaron Rodgers did <i>not</i> have a triumphant return, because apparently the recovery time from COVID isn't sped up by homeopathic Shailene Woodley coconut oil rubdowns.<br>
    <br>
    Had Rodgers just had a sorta bad day instead of a really bad day, IPP would have seized control of the West(ish) Coast. But he did not, so they did not.<br>
<br>
	<div class="section-header">Hornets 149.1 | Lanniesters 140.4</div>
    Just when it looked like the Hornets might be bowing out of the race in the Old Big 8 after two straight losses, they go and rattle off two straight wins to keep within striking distance of the Longshanks and Monkeys. They're also, for what it's worth, actually the top scoring team in that division—no, wait, not just the division...the entire <i>league.</i> Did you guys know that? I didn't. Until just now. But they do have the league's #1 RB (J. Taylor), #4 QB (Lamar), and #10 WR (J. Jefferson). Hell, even Kirk Cousins is in the top 10 in QB scoring to date.<br>
<br>
    Good on you, Mountain Time.<br>
<br>
	<div class="section-header">Jesus 130.7 | Falcons 110.1</div>
    From the league's top scorer to the league's bottom scorer, yet with the same result. Jesus is enjoying the precious little time it has with Christian McCaffrey before he inevitably heads right back to the IR soon.<br>
<br>
    Also, someone check my sports math here, but I'm pretty sure Jesus could clinch a division title next week, even with a loss (if Odouls and Boom also lose). They've got a four-game lead with four to play, right? Goodness, how fucking bad is the Holy Trinity Division. (Real bad.)<br>
<br>
	<div class="section-header">Saquonda 133.0 | Boom 102.7</div>
    Speaking of bad, this was a game between a 2-7 team and another 2-7 team! /end writeup<br>
<br>
	<div class="section-header">Monkeys 132.5 | Longshanks 76.2</div>
    The Monkeys had a four-game winning streak snapped last week, but bounced back nicely to prevent the Longshanks from extending their lead in the Old Big 8. This is a dangerously consistent team; the Monkeys haven't scored fewer than 122.2 points all season. They also scored 203.3 one week, so don't mistake the consistent output with a lack of high-end upside, because that's there too. And the Shanks finally had the game they've (I've?) been fearing for some time now. I.e., a shitty one.
