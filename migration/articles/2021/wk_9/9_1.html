<div class="tagline">2-12 would be better than 1-13—right?</div>

	This is the JADDL, so naturally, when a 6-2 team faces off against a 1-7 team, you expect the 1-7 team to win. And that's just what happened as Saquonda (checks notes...) For1season took on Team Hauloll in Week 9. Saquonda rode the back of their RB1, who (checks notes...) is not actually Saquon Barkley, but rather James Conner. Perhaps Nate should've gone with a Terminator theme instead? No, wait, that guy wasn't James Conner; it was (checks notes...) John Connor. Damn.<br>
<br>
	Anyway, James Conner tore Hauloll up with 42.3 points, and Saquonda Forwhatever dispatched Team Hauloll 146.9-128.4 for their second win of the season. And that's pretty huge, because with the extra game this season, the newly possible 1-13 mark Saquonda was barreling toward would've been the worst season in league history, dipping below the 1-12 campaigns of Christmases past by the Longshanks (2012) and Monkeys (2016). Of note, Football Jesus also had a one-win season in 2007, but that was a 1-9-3 record—three ties! Do you remember that shit?<br><br>
	<div class="section-header">Bensons 121.1 | Boom 120.1</div>
	What a game! A one-point margin? Dak Prescott getting obliterated by the Von Miller-less Broncos for 3.8 quarters, only to get two garbage time TDs that the Bensons needed every last point from? The Bensons nearly losing due to the Bills Coach getting zilch against the <i>Jaguars?!</i> So many fun storylines—and yet, it's not fun, because Pete isn't here to relive them. Good call, Pete.<br>
<br>
	This keeps the Bensons just two games back in the Winterfell Division as well, so yeah, I'm imagining a whole lot of fist pumps happened in Alex's living room Sunday night.<br><br>
	<div class="section-header">Hornets 151.5 | Monkeys 122.2</div>
	Finally, a divisional game in the Old Big 8. Talk about a backloaded schedule. This will be a fun home stretch for this ultra competitive division. Only 18 points separate all three teams, all of which have winning records. All three are also in the top five in league-wide scoring. In Ryan's attempt as the first picker out on the dodgeball court at recess to create a weak division to feast on, he created a damn super division instead. Well done.<br>
<br>
	And yes, this game—in Week 9, remember—was the first between these divisional foes, with the Hornets getting the better of the duel thanks to studs Jonathan Taylor (RB 2) and Lamar Jackson (QB 3) doing their thing. To combat that, the Monkeys needed a special Joe Burrow performance, and instead, he gave them 7.3 points.<br><br>
	<div class="section-header">Lanniesters 133.2 | IPP 110.7</div>
	Not to be outdone by division rival and competitor for whatever the JADDL's equivalent of the MLS Supporter's Shield is, IPP wanted to match Team Hauloll's disappointing loss, and they did just that. Patrick Mahomes is human and looking likely to stay at least partially human for the remainder of the year, and—at least for the moment—Aaron Rodgers is now Jordan Love, who is not Aaron Rodgers. For instance, Jordan Love is vaccinated. He listened to medical experts and didn't do his own research with the help of Joe Rogan. He doesn't go on random podcasts to spout <i>Something woke mob bla bla come cancel me bruh yadda yadda invermectin.</i><br>
<br>
	But he also isn't as good at football, yet, so IPP subsequently isn't as good at fantasy football right now either.<br>
<br>
	Fun fact: the Lanniesters' Carson Wentz outscored Mahomes and Love combined.<br><br>
	<div class="section-header">Falcons 141.3 | Odouls 98.6</div>
	It'a hard to believe Team Odouls started out 1-0, with a win over IPP. But they did. And then they've gone 1-7 since. Remember when Derek Carr was good? Oh, and his coach was Jon Gruden? Seems like ages ago when either one of those things could be true. The Falcons, meanwhile, have won two straight to grab ahold of first place in the Winterfell Division.<br><br>
	<div class="section-header">Longshanks 138.8 | Jesus 72.3</div>
	Mike White (that's the current QB for the New York Jets, FYI) scored 26 points a week ago, and you just know how much James loves that shit. Alas, he rewarded the roster add by putting up just 7.8 this time out. You know how you score 72.3 points total? You get 11.7 points from your QB1, QB2, kicker, D/ST, and Coach...combined. That means each of those spots averaged 2.3 points apiece for Jesus this week. That 72.3 mark is the lowest score in the league this season, by a long shot. (The next lowest is 90.3 by, surprisingly, Team Hauloll.) That's all the bad news for Jesus. The good news? His division is putrid, so he's still got a commanding three-game lead on Mighty Boom and Odouls.<br>
<br>
	And the Shanks? They just keep winning. That's four straight, putting them atop the Old Big 8 for the first time since Week 4.
