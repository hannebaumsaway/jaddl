	Quarterbacks are often maligned in the fantasy football world. The gap between the studs and duds isn't necessarily as great as those of other position groups. You all know that. Nevertheless, stocking your roster with the likes of Patrick Mahomes and Jeopardy! host Aaron Rodgers is going to give you a pretty decent floor—not to mention an OK ceiling height, too.<br>
<br>
	Such is the height of that floor that IPP can go out and get a big fat 0.0 from its TE (some guy named Juwan Johnson) and still put up 166.1 for a second Briefly Badass in three weeks. The game itself? Oh, that was a 166.1–124.2 drubbing of the Angry Monkeys. I looked through the box score for some humorous or notable anecdote about the Monkeys' performance, but there weren't any. Boooooring.<br>
<br>
	<div class="section-header">Longshanks 145.9 | Bensons 133.2</div>
	Let's be clear: the refs saved the Longshanks in this one. Despite a sizable lead going into MNF, the Bensons wasted no time in marching toward a comeback, as Dak Prescott and Zeke tore the Eagles up without resistance. But a Dak TD pass <i>to Zeke</i> was nullified by a penalty, wiping about 12 points off the board, and a Dak QB sneak that appeared to clearly break the goal line was looked at under the hood by the instant replay crew, and they inexplicably said, "Nothing to see here," and another 6-ish points was kept off the board, just like that. An 18-point swing in a 13-point loss is gonna sting a bit.<br>
<br>
	<div class="section-header">Hornets 135.0 | Saquonda 148.9</div>
	The quest for an undefeated season is over for the Hornets, and the horror of an 0-13 (14? how many games do we play now) season is over for Saquonda-Not-Trumpsters. Josh Allen reprised his role as a champion from last year's Shanks squad and exploded for 37.1 points, while a far more unexpected boom came from The Other QB, Sam Darnold (25.1).<br>
<br>
	<div class="section-header">Odouls 128.1 | Boom 146.7</div>
	That trade for Justin Herbert (giving away Corey Davis and Matt Stafford) sure looks a lot better to Pete today than it did prior to this weekend. Herbert went out and popped Odouls for 30.8 points, and another 23.1 were chipped in by Alexander "Not Dalvin Cook" Mattison. It was more than enough, considering Odouls got a whopping 5.3 total points from their RB2 and WR1, combined.<br>
<br>
	<div class="section-header">Falcons 154.0 | Lanniesters 125.4</div>
	If the Lanniesters want to get a W—and the next one will be their <i>first</i> one—they're probably going to need more than 7.3 points from Sunshine Lawrence in that de facto QB2 slot. Tom Brady is only getting older week by week in the QB1 position, and he's already old as fuck, as you know. The Falcons, led by newly married dude Ian—congrats!—were able to stroll to their second win thanks in large part to Mike Williams getting to feast on the Chiefs' so-called "defense" to the tune of 33.2 points.<br>
<br>
	<div class="section-header">Jesus 114.7 | Hauloll 159.0</div>
	Hauloll is undefeated and stands today as the best team in the league, in the early going (as in, they lead the league in points scored, guys). And that's with Taylor Heinicke starting! He's a quarterback for Washington Football Team, if you didn't know. And no one would blame you if you didn't. Cooper Kupp is also seriously enjoying having Matt Stafford in La La Land, and Justin Tucker just calmly adds to the fun with (NFL) game-winning 66-yard bombs.<br>
<br>
	Jesus got a really nice performance from Najee Harris, and—well, that's about it. Famous Jameis and Big Ben raced to the bottom, and Ben won, just barely, with 13.1 points to Jameis's 13.4. Woof.
